David Durkin
  * David worked primarily on building the implementation of the Trie and loading the dictionary into the Trie. He was the one who discovered the Trie data structure. He also helped fix errors in the suggestion algorithms.

Chris Beaufils
  * Chris worked together with Matt to build the suggestions engine. This involved implementing the Levenshtein distance algorithm, as well as implementing our own suggestion algorithm to find similar words. Chris also helped David with parsing the dictionaries' thousands and thousands of words/definitions.

Matt Reilly
  * Matt worked together with Chris on the custom and Levenshtein algorithms, as described above. He also created the Makefile and helped David fix some errors on the search algorithm for the Trie.

All group members collaborated on the presentation and in building measure.cpp. We were all together for 100% of the work done, which allowed for quick communication and fluid work.
