tell	15
me	15
o	15
muse	15
of	15
that	15
ingenious	15
hero	15
who	15
travelled	15
far	15
and	15
wide	15
after	16
he	16
had	16
sacked	16
the	16
famous	16
town	16
of	16
troy	16
many	16
cities	16
did	16
he	16
visit	16
and	17
many	17
were	17
the	17
nations	17
with	17
whose	17
manners	17
and	17
customs	17
he	17
was	17
acquainted	17
moreover	18
he	18
suffered	18
much	18
by	18
sea	18
while	18
trying	18
to	18
save	18
his	18
own	18
life	18
and	19
bring	19
his	19
men	19
safely	19

do	19
what	19
he	19
might	19
he	19
could	19
not	19
save	19
his	20
men	20
for	20
they	20
perished	20
through	20
their	20
own	20
sheer	20
folly	20
in	20
eating	20
the	21
cattle	21
of	21
the	21
sun-god	21
hyperion	21
so	21
the	21
god	21
prevented	21
them	21
from	21
ever	22
reaching	22
home	22
tell	22
me	22
too	22
about	22
all	22
these	22
things	22
o	22
daughter	22
of	23
jove	23
from	23
whatsoever	23
source	23
you	23
may	23
know	23
them	23
so	25
now	25
all	25
who	25
escaped	25
death	25
in	25
battle	25
or	25
by	25
shipwreck	25
had	25
got	25
safely	25
home	26
except	26
ulysses	26
and	26
he	26
though	26
he	26
was	26
longing	26
to	26
return	26
to	26
his	26
wife	27
and	27
country	27
was	27
detained	27
by	27
the	27
goddess	27
calypso	27
who	27
had	27
got	27
him	28
into	28
a	28
large	28
cave	28
and	28
wanted	28
to	28
marry	28
him	28
but	28
as	28
years	28
went	28
by	28
there	29
came	29
a	29
time	29
when	29
the	29
gods	29
settled	29
that	29
he	29
should	29
go	29
back	29
to	29
ithaca	30
even	30
then	30
however	30
when	30
he	30
was	30
among	30
his	30
own	30
people	30
his	30
troubles	31
were	31
not	31
yet	31
over	31
nevertheless	31
all	31
the	31
gods	31
had	31
now	31
begun	31
to	32
pity	32
him	32
except	32
neptune	32
who	32
still	32
persecuted	32
him	32
without	32
ceasing	32
and	33
would	33
not	33
let	33
him	33
get	33
home	33
now	35
neptune	35
had	35
gone	35
off	35
to	35
the	35
ethiopians	35
who	35
are	35
at	35
the	35
world's	35
end	36
and	36
lie	36
in	36
two	36
halves	36
the	36
one	36
looking	36
west	36
and	36
the	36
other	36
east	36
he	37
had	37
gone	37
there	37
to	37
accept	37
a	37
hecatomb	37
of	37
sheep	37
and	37
oxen	37
and	37
was	37
enjoying	38
himself	38
at	38
his	38
festival	38
but	38
the	38
other	38
gods	38
met	38
in	38
the	38
house	38
of	39
olympian	39
jove	39
and	39
the	39
sire	39
of	39
gods	39
and	39
men	39
spoke	39
first	39
at	39
that	39
moment	40
he	40
was	40
thinking	40
of	40
aegisthus	40
who	40
had	40
been	40
killed	40
by	40
agamemnon's	40
son	41
orestes	41
so	41
he	41
said	41
to	41
the	41
other	41
gods	41
see	43
now	43
how	43
men	43
lay	43
blame	43
upon	43
us	43
gods	43
for	43
what	43
is	43
after	43
all	43
nothing	43
but	44
their	44
own	44
folly	44
look	44
at	44
aegisthus	44
he	44
must	44
needs	44
make	44
love	44
to	44
agamemnon's	45
wife	45
unrighteously	45
and	45
then	45
kill	45
agamemnon	45
though	45
he	45
knew	46
it	46
would	46
be	46
the	46
death	46
of	46
him	46
for	46
i	46
sent	46
mercury	46
to	46
warn	46
him	46
not	47
to	47
do	47
either	47
of	47
these	47
things	47
inasmuch	47
as	47
orestes	47
would	47
be	47
sure	47
to	48
take	48
his	48
revenge	48
when	48
he	48
grew	48
up	48
and	48
wanted	48
to	48
return	48
home	48
mercury	48
told	49
him	49
this	49
in	49
all	49
good	49
will	49
but	49
he	49
would	49
not	49
listen	49
and	49
now	49
he	49
has	50
paid	50
for	50
everything	50
in	50
full	50
then	52
minerva	52
said	52
father	52
son	52
of	52
saturn	52
king	52
of	52
kings	52
it	52
served	52
aegisthus	53
right	53
and	53
so	53
it	53
would	53
any	53
one	53
else	53
who	53
does	53
as	53
he	53
did	53
but	54
aegisthus	54
is	54
neither	54
here	54
nor	54
there	54
it	54
is	54
for	54
ulysses	54
that	54
my	54
heart	55
bleeds	55
when	55
i	55
think	55
of	55
his	55
sufferings	55
in	55
that	55
lonely	55
sea-girt	55
island	56
far	56
away	56
poor	56
man	56
from	56
all	56
his	56
friends	56
it	56
is	56
an	56
island	56
covered	57
with	57
forest	57
in	57
the	57
very	57
middle	57
of	57
the	57
sea	57
and	57
a	57
goddess	57
lives	58
there	58
daughter	58
of	58
the	58
magician	58
atlas	58
who	58
looks	58
after	58
the	58
bottom	58
of	59
the	59
ocean	59
and	59
carries	59
the	59
great	59
columns	59
that	59
keep	59
heaven	59
and	59
earth	59
asunder	60
this	60
daughter	60
of	60
atlas	60
has	60
got	60
hold	60
of	60
poor	60
unhappy	60
ulysses	60
and	61
keeps	61
trying	61
by	61
every	61
kind	61
of	61
blandishment	61
to	61
make	61
him	61
forget	61
his	62
home	62
so	62
that	62
he	62
is	62
tired	62
of	62
life	62
and	62
thinks	62
of	62
nothing	62
but	62
how	62
he	63
may	63
once	63
more	63
see	63
the	63
smoke	63
of	63
his	63
own	63
chimneys	63
you	63
sir	63
take	63
no	64
heed	64
of	64
this	64
and	64
yet	64
when	64
ulysses	64
was	64
before	64
troy	64
did	64
he	64
not	64
propitiate	64
you	65
with	65
many	65
a	65
burnt	65
sacrifice	65
why	65
then	65
should	65
you	65
keep	65
on	65
being	65
so	66
angry	66
with	66
him	66
and	68
jove	68

you	68
talking	68
about	68
how	68

there	69
is	69
no	69
more	69

more	69
liberal	70

the	70
immortal	70
gods	70
that	70
live	70
in	70
heaven	70

in	71
mind	71
however	71
that	71
neptune	71
is	71
still	71
furious	71
with	71
ulysses	71
for	72
having	72
blinded	72

outright	74
he	74
torments	74
him	74
by	75
preventing	75
him	75

that	80
ulysses	80

he	104
was	104
sitting	104
moodily	104
among	105
the	105
suitors	105
thinking	105
about	105
his	105
brave	105
father	105
and	105
how	105
he	105
would	105
send	106
them	106
flying	106
out	106
of	106
the	106
house	106
if	106
he	106

and	107
be	107
honoured	107
as	107

brooding	107

he	108
caught	108
sight	108
of	108
minerva	108

went	108
straight	108
to	108
the	108
gate	108
for	108

was	109
vexed	109
that	109
a	109
stranger	109
should	109
be	109
kept	109
waiting	109
for	109
admittance	109
he	110
took	110
her	110
right	110
hand	110
in	110
his	110
own	110
and	110
bade	110
her	110
give	110
him	110
her	110
spear	110
welcome	111
said	111
he	111
to	111
our	111
house	111
and	111
when	111
you	111
have	111
partaken	111
of	111
food	111
you	112
shall	112
tell	112
us	112
what	112
you	112
have	112
come	112
for	112

led	114
the	114
way	114
as	114
he	114
spoke	114
and	114
minerva	114
followed	114
him	114
when	114
they	114
were	114
within	115

took	115
her	115
spear	115
and	115
set	115
it	115
in	115
the	115

against	115
a	115

along	116
with	116
the	116
many	116
other	116
spears	116
of	116
his	116
unhappy	116
father	117

he	117
conducted	117
her	117
to	117
a	117
richly	117
decorated	117
seat	117
under	117
which	117
he	118

was	118
a	118
footstool	118
also	118
for	118

he	119
set	119
another	119
seat	119
near	119
her	119
for	119
himself	119
away	119
from	119
the	119

while	120
eating	120
by	120
their	120
noise	120
and	120
insolence	120
and	121
that	121

more	121
freely	121
about	121
his	121
father	121

a	124
silver	124
basin	124
for	124
them	124
to	124
wash	124
their	124

in	126
the	126
house	127
the	127
carver	127
fetched	127
them	127
plates	127
of	127
all	127
manner	127
of	127
meats	127
and	127
set	127
cups	128
of	128
gold	128
by	128
their	128
side	128
and	128
a	128
man-servant	128
brought	128
them	128
wine	128
and	128
poured	129
it	129
out	129
for	129
them	129
then	131
the	131
suitors	131
came	131
in	131
and	131
took	131
their	131
places	131
on	131
the	131
benches	131
and	131
seats	132
forthwith	132
men	132
servants	132
poured	132
water	132
over	132
their	132
hands	132
maids	132
went	133
round	133
with	133
the	133
bread-baskets	133
pages	133
filled	133
the	133
mixing-bowls	133
with	133
wine	134
and	134
water	134
and	134
they	134
laid	134
their	134
hands	134
upon	134
the	134
good	134
things	134
that	134
were	135
before	135
them	135
as	135
soon	135
as	135
they	135
had	135
had	135
enough	135
to	135
eat	135
and	135
drink	135
they	136
wanted	136
music	136
and	136
dancing	136
which	136
are	136
the	136
crowning	136
embellishments	136
of	137
a	137
banquet	137
so	137
a	137
servant	137
brought	137
a	137
lyre	137
to	137
phemius	137
whom	137
they	137
compelled	137
perforce	138
to	138
sing	138
to	138
them	138
as	138
soon	138
as	138
he	138
touched	138
his	138
lyre	138
and	138
began	138
to	139
sing	139
telemachus	139
spoke	139
low	139
to	139
minerva	139
with	139
his	139
head	139
close	139
to	139
hers	139
that	140
no	140
man	140
might	140
hear	140
i	142
hope	142
sir	142
said	142
he	142
that	142
you	142
will	142
not	142
be	142
offended	142
with	142
what	142
i	142
am	143
going	143
to	143
say	143
singing	143
comes	143
cheap	143
to	143
those	143
who	143
do	143
not	143
pay	143
for	143
it	143
and	144
all	144
this	144
is	144
done	144
at	144
the	144
cost	144
of	144
one	144
whose	144
bones	144
lie	144
rotting	144
in	144
some	145
wilderness	145
or	145
grinding	145
to	145
powder	145
in	145
the	145
surf	145
if	145
these	145
men	145
were	145
to	146
see	146
my	146
father	146
come	146
back	146
to	146
ithaca	146
they	146
would	146
pray	146
for	146
longer	146
legs	146
rather	147
than	147
a	147
longer	147
purse	147
for	147
money	147
would	147
not	147
serve	147
them	147
but	147
he	147
alas	148
has	148
fallen	148
on	148
an	148
ill	148
fate	148
and	148
even	148
when	148
people	148
do	148
sometimes	148
say	149
that	149
he	149
is	149
coming	149
we	149
no	149
longer	149
heed	149
them	149
we	149
shall	149
never	149

brought	152
you	152

father's	155
time	155

the	155
old	155
days	156

had	156
many	156
visitors	156

with	160
my	160
ship	160
and	160
crew	160
on	160
a	160
voyage	160
to	160
men	160
of	160
a	160
foreign	160
tongue	161
being	161
bound	161
for	161
temesa	161
with	161
a	161
cargo	161
of	161
iron	161
and	161
i	161
shall	161
bring	161
back	162
copper	162
as	162
for	162
my	162
ship	162
it	162
lies	162
over	162
yonder	162
off	162
the	162
open	162
country	162
away	163
from	163
the	163
town	163
in	163
the	163
harbour	163
rheithron	163
under	163
the	163
wooded	163
mountain	163
neritum	164
our	164
fathers	164
were	164
friends	164
before	164
us	164
as	164
old	164
laertes	164
will	164
tell	164
you	165
if	165
you	165
will	165
go	165
and	165
ask	165
him	165
they	165
say	165
however	165
that	165
he	165
never	165
comes	166
to	166
town	166
now	166
and	166
lives	166
by	166
himself	166
in	166
the	166
country	166
faring	166
hardly	166
with	167
an	167
old	167
woman	167
to	167
look	167
after	167
him	167
and	167
get	167
his	167
dinner	167
for	167
him	167
when	167
he	168
comes	168
in	168
tired	168
from	168
pottering	168
about	168
his	168
vineyard	168
they	168
told	168
me	168
your	169
father	169
was	169
at	169
home	169
again	169
and	169
that	169
was	169
why	169
i	169
came	169
but	169
it	169
seems	169
the	170
gods	170
are	170
still	170
keeping	170
him	170
back	170
for	170
he	170
is	170
not	170
dead	170
yet	170
not	170
on	170
the	171
mainland	171
it	171
is	171
more	171
likely	171
he	171
is	171
on	171
some	171
sea-girt	171
island	171
in	171
mid	171
ocean	172
or	172
a	172
prisoner	172
among	172
savages	172
who	172
are	172
detaining	172
him	172
against	172
his	172
will	173
i	173
am	173
no	173
prophet	173
and	173
know	173
very	173
little	173
about	173
omens	173
but	173
i	173
speak	173
as	174
it	174
is	174
borne	174
in	174
upon	174
me	174
from	174
heaven	174
and	174
assure	174
you	174
that	174
he	174
will	174
not	175
be	175
away	175
much	175
longer	175
for	175
he	175
is	175
a	175
man	175
of	175
such	175
resource	175
that	175
even	175
though	176
he	176
were	176
in	176
chains	176
of	176
iron	176
he	176
would	176
find	176
some	176
means	176
of	176
getting	176
home	177
again	177
but	177
tell	177
me	177
and	177
tell	177
me	177
true	177
can	177
ulysses	177
really	177
have	177
such	178
a	178
fine	178
looking	178
fellow	178
for	178
a	178
son	178
you	178
are	178
indeed	178
wonderfully	178
like	178
him	179
about	179
the	179
head	179
and	179
eyes	179
for	179
we	179
were	179
close	179
friends	179
before	179
he	179
set	179
sail	180
for	180
troy	180
where	180
the	180
flower	180
of	180
all	180
the	180
argives	180
went	180
also	180
since	180
that	181
time	181
we	181
have	181
never	181
either	181
of	181
us	181
seen	181
the	181
other	181
my	183
mother	183
answered	183
telemachus	183
tells	183
me	183
i	183
am	183
son	183
to	183
ulysses	183
but	183
it	184
is	184
a	184
wise	184
child	184
that	184
knows	184
his	184
own	184
father	184
would	184
that	184
i	184
were	184
son	184
to	185
one	185
who	185
had	185
grown	185
old	185
upon	185
his	185
own	185
estates	185
for	185
since	185
you	185
ask	185
me	186
there	186
is	186
no	186
more	186
ill-starred	186
man	186
under	186
heaven	186
than	186
he	186
who	186
they	186
tell	187
me	187
is	187
my	187
father	187
and	189
minerva	189
said	189
there	189
is	189
no	189
fear	189
of	189
your	189
race	189
dying	189
out	189
yet	189
while	189
penelope	190
has	190
such	190
a	190
fine	190
son	190
as	190
you	190
are	190
but	190
tell	190
me	190
and	190
tell	190
me	190
true	191
what	191
is	191
the	191
meaning	191
of	191
all	191
this	191
feasting	191
and	191
who	191
are	191
these	191
people	192
what	192
is	192
it	192
all	192
about	192
have	192
you	192
some	192
banquet	192
or	192
is	192
there	192
a	192
wedding	193
in	193
the	193
family	193
for	193
no	193
one	193
seems	193
to	193
be	193
bringing	193
any	193
provisions	193
of	194
his	194
own	194
and	194
the	194
guests	194
how	194
atrociously	194
they	194
are	194
behaving	194
what	194
riot	195
they	195
make	195
over	195
the	195
whole	195
house	195
it	195
is	195
enough	195
to	195
disgust	195
any	195
respectable	195
person	196
who	196
comes	196
near	196
them	196
sir	198
said	198
telemachus	198
as	198
regards	198
your	198
question	198
so	198
long	198
as	198
my	198
father	198
was	199
here	199
it	199
was	199
well	199
with	199
us	199
and	199
with	199
the	199
house	199
but	199
the	199
gods	199
in	199
their	199
displeasure	200
have	200
willed	200
it	200
otherwise	200
and	200
have	200
hidden	200
him	200
away	200
more	200
closely	201
than	201
mortal	201
man	201
was	201
ever	201
yet	201
hidden	201
i	201
could	201
have	201
borne	201
it	201
better	202
even	202
though	202
he	202
were	202
dead	202
if	202
he	202
had	202
fallen	202
with	202
his	202
men	202
before	202
troy	203
or	203
had	203
died	203
with	203
friends	203
around	203
him	203
when	203
the	203
days	203
of	203
his	203
fighting	203
were	204
done	204
for	204
then	204
the	204
achaeans	204
would	204
have	204
built	204
a	204
mound	204
over	204
his	204
ashes	205
and	205
i	205
should	205
myself	205
have	205
been	205
heir	205
to	205
his	205
renown	205
but	205
now	205
the	205
storm-winds	206
have	206
spirited	206
him	206
away	206
we	206
know	206
not	206
wither	206
he	206
is	206
gone	206
without	207
leaving	207
so	207
much	207
as	207
a	207
trace	207
behind	207
him	207
and	207
i	207
inherit	207
nothing	207
but	208
dismay	208
nor	208
does	208
the	208
matter	208
end	208
simply	208
with	208
grief	208
for	208
the	208
loss	208
of	209
my	209
father	209
heaven	209
has	209
laid	209
sorrows	209
upon	209
me	209
of	209
yet	209
another	209
kind	209
for	210
the	210
chiefs	210
from	210
all	210
our	210
islands	210
dulichium	210
same	210
and	210
the	210
woodland	210
island	211
of	211
zacynthus	211
as	211
also	211
all	211
the	211
principal	211
men	211
of	211
ithaca	211
itself	211
are	212
eating	212
up	212
my	212
house	212
under	212
the	212
pretext	212
of	212
paying	212
their	212
court	212
to	212
my	213
mother	213
who	213
will	213
neither	213
point	213
blank	213
say	213
that	213
she	213
will	213
not	213
marry	213
nor	214
yet	214
bring	214
matters	214
to	214
an	214
end	214
so	214
they	214
are	214
making	214
havoc	214
of	214
my	214
estate	214
and	215
before	215
long	215
will	215
do	215
so	215
also	215
with	215
myself	215
is	217
that	217
so	217
exclaimed	217
minerva	217
then	217
you	217
do	217
indeed	217
want	217
ulysses	217
home	218
again	218
give	218
him	218
his	218
helmet	218
shield	218
and	218
a	218
couple	218
lances	218
and	218
if	219
he	219
is	219
the	219
man	219
he	219
was	219
when	219
i	219
first	219
knew	219
him	219
in	219
our	219
house	219
drinking	219
and	220
making	220
merry	220
he	220
would	220
soon	220
lay	220
his	220
hands	220
about	220
these	220
rascally	220
suitors	221
were	221
he	221
to	221
stand	221
once	221
more	221
upon	221
his	221
own	221
threshold	221
he	221
was	221
then	222
coming	222
from	222
ephyra	222
where	222
he	222
had	222
been	222
to	222
beg	222
poison	222
for	222
his	222
arrows	222
from	223
ilus	223
son	223
of	223
mermerus	223
ilus	223

eurymachus	334
son	334
of	334
polybus	334
answered	334
it	334
rests	334
with	334
heaven	334
to	334
decide	335
who	335
shall	335
be	335
chief	335
among	335
us	335
but	335
you	335
shall	335
be	335
master	335
in	335
your	335
own	336
house	336
and	336

shall	337
do	337
you	337
violence	337
nor	337
rob	337
you	337
and	337
now	337
my	337
good	337
fellow	337
i	338
want	338
to	338
know	338
about	338
this	338
stranger	338
what	338
country	338
does	338
he	338
come	338
from	338
of	339
what	339
family	339
is	339
he	339
and	339
where	339
is	339
his	339
estate	339
has	339
he	339
brought	339
you	339
news	340
about	340
the	340
return	340
of	340
your	340
father	340
or	340
was	340
he	340
on	340
business	340
of	340
his	340
own	341
he	341
seemed	341
a	341
well-to-do	341
man	341
but	341
he	341
hurried	341
off	341
so	341
suddenly	341
that	341
he	342
was	342
gone	342
in	342
a	342
moment	342
before	342
we	342
could	342
get	342
to	342
know	342
him	342
my	344
father	344
is	344
dead	344
and	344
gone	344
answered	344
telemachus	344
and	344
even	344
if	344
some	344
rumour	345
reaches	345
me	345
i	345
put	345
no	345
more	345
faith	345
in	345
it	345
now	345
my	345
mother	345
does	345
indeed	345
sometimes	346
send	346
for	346
a	346
soothsayer	346
and	346
question	346
him	346
but	346
i	346
give	346
his	346
prophecyings	346
no	347
heed	347
as	347
for	347
the	347
stranger	347
he	347
was	347
mentes	347
son	347
of	347
anchialus	347
chief	347
of	348
the	348
taphians	348
an	348
old	348
friend	348
of	348
my	348
father's	348
but	348
in	348
his	348
heart	348
he	348
knew	349
that	349
it	349
had	349
been	349
the	349
goddess	349
the	351
suitors	351
then	351
returned	351
to	351
their	351
singing	351
and	351
dancing	351
until	351
the	351
evening	351
but	352
when	352
night	352
fell	352
upon	352
their	352
pleasuring	352
they	352
went	352
home	352
to	352
bed	352
each	352
in	353
his	353
own	353
abode	353
telemachus's	353
room	353
was	353
high	353
up	353
in	353
a	353
tower	353
that	353
looked	353
on	354
to	354
the	354
outer	354
court	354
hither	354
then	354
he	354
hied	354
brooding	354
and	354
full	354
of	354
thought	355
a	355
good	355
old	355
woman	355
euryclea	355
daughter	355
of	355
ops	355
the	355
son	355

before	356
him	356
with	356
a	356
couple	356
of	356
blazing	356
torches	356
laertes	356
had	356
bought	356
her	357
with	357
his	357
own	357
money	357
when	357
she	357
was	357
quite	357
young	357
he	357
gave	357
the	357
worth	357
of	358
twenty	358
oxen	358
for	358
her	358
and	358
shewed	358
as	358
much	358
respect	358
to	358
her	358
in	358
his	358
household	358
as	359
he	359
did	359
to	359
his	359
own	359
wedded	359
wife	359
but	359
he	359
did	359
not	359
take	359
her	359
to	359
his	359
bed	359
for	360
he	360
feared	360
his	360
wife's	360
resentment	360
she	360
it	360
was	360
who	360
now	360
lighted	360
telemachus	360
to	361
his	361
room	361
and	361
she	361
loved	361
him	361
better	361
than	361
any	361
of	361
the	361
other	361
women	361
in	362
the	362
house	362
did	362
for	362
she	362
had	362
nursed	362
him	362
when	362
he	362
was	362
a	362
baby	362
he	362
opened	362
the	363
door	363
of	363
his	363
bed	363
room	363
and	363
sat	363
down	363
upon	363
the	363
bed	363
as	363
he	363
took	363
off	363
his	364
shirt	364
he	364
gave	364
it	364
to	364
the	364
good	364
old	364
woman	364
who	364
folded	364
it	364
tidily	364
up	364
and	365
hung	365
it	365
for	365
him	365
over	365
a	365
peg	365
by	365
his	365
bed	365
side	365
after	365
which	365
she	365
went	365
out	366
pulled	366
the	366
door	366
to	366
by	366
a	366
silver	366
catch	366
and	366
drew	366
the	366
bolt	366
home	366
by	367
means	367
of	367
the	367
strap	367
but	367
telemachus	367
as	367
he	367
lay	367
covered	367
with	367
a	367
woollen	367
fleece	368
kept	368
thinking	368
all	368
night	368
through	368
of	368
his	368
intended	368
voyage	368
of	368
the	368

minerva	369
had	369
given	369
him	369

ii	373
now	375
when	375
the	375
child	375
of	375
morning	375
rosy-fingered	375
dawn	375
appeared	375
telemachus	375
rose	376
and	376
dressed	376
himself	376
he	376
bound	376
his	376
sandals	376
on	376
to	376
his	376
comely	376
feet	376
girded	377
his	377
sword	377
about	377
his	377
shoulder	377
and	377
left	377
his	377
room	377
looking	377
like	377
an	378
immortal	378
god	378
he	378
at	378
once	378
sent	378
the	378
criers	378
round	378
to	378
call	378
the	378
people	378
in	379
assembly	379
so	379
they	379
called	379
them	379
and	379
the	379
people	379
gathered	379
thereon	379
then	380
when	380
they	380
were	380
got	380
together	380
he	380
went	380
to	380
the	380
place	380
of	380
assembly	380
spear	381
in	381
hand	381
not	381
alone	381
for	381
his	381
two	381
hounds	381
went	381
with	381
him	381
minerva	381
endowed	382
him	382
with	382
a	382
presence	382
of	382
such	382
divine	382
comeliness	382
that	382
all	382
marvelled	382
at	383
him	383
as	383
he	383
went	383
by	383
and	383
when	383
he	383
took	383
his	383
place	383
in	383
his	383
father's	383
seat	384
even	384
the	384
oldest	384
councillors	384
made	384
way	384
for	384
him	384
aegyptius	386
a	386
man	386
bent	386
double	386
with	386
age	386
and	386
of	386
infinite	386
experience	386
the	387
first	387
to	387
speak	387
his	387
son	387
antiphus	387
had	387
gone	387
with	387
ulysses	387
to	387
ilius	387
land	388
of	388
noble	388
steeds	388
but	388
the	388
savage	388
cyclops	388
had	388
killed	388
him	388
when	388
they	388
were	389
all	389
shut	389
up	389
in	389
the	389
cave	389
and	389
had	389
cooked	389
his	389
last	389
dinner	389
for	389
him	389
he	390
had	390
three	390
sons	390
left	390
of	390
whom	390
two	390
still	390
worked	390
on	390
their	390
father's	390
land	391
while	391
the	391
third	391
eurynomus	391
was	391
one	391
of	391
the	391
suitors	391
nevertheless	391
their	392
father	392
could	392
not	392
get	392
over	392
the	392
loss	392
of	392
antiphus	392
and	392
was	392
still	392
weeping	393
for	393
him	393
when	393
he	393
began	393
his	393
speech	393
men	395
of	395
ithaca	395
he	395
said	395
hear	395
my	395
words	395
from	395
the	395
day	395
ulysses	395
left	395
us	396
there	396
has	396
been	396
no	396
meeting	396
of	396
our	396
councillors	396
until	396
now	396
who	396
then	396
can	397
it	397
be	397
whether	397
old	397
or	397
young	397
that	397
finds	397
it	397
so	397
necessary	397
to	397
convene	397
us	398
has	398
he	398
got	398
wind	398
of	398
some	398
host	398
approaching	398
and	398
does	398
he	398
wish	398
to	398
warn	399
us	399
or	399
would	399
he	399
speak	399
upon	399
some	399
other	399
matter	399
of	399
public	399
moment	399
i	400
am	400
sure	400
he	400
is	400
an	400
excellent	400
person	400
and	400
i	400
hope	400
jove	400
will	400
grant	400
him	400
his	401
heart's	401
desire	401
telemachus	403
took	403
this	403
speech	403
as	403
of	403
good	403
omen	403
and	403
rose	403
at	403
once	403
for	403
he	404
was	404
bursting	404
with	404
what	404
he	404
had	404
to	404
say	404
he	404
stood	404
in	404
the	404
middle	404
of	404
the	405
assembly	405
and	405
the	405
good	405
herald	405
pisenor	405
brought	405
him	405
his	405
staff	405
then	405
turning	406
to	406
aegyptius	406
sir	406
said	406
he	406
it	406
is	406
i	406
as	406
you	406
will	406
shortly	406
learn	407
who	407
have	407
convened	407
you	407
for	407
it	407
is	407
i	407
who	407
am	407
the	407
most	407
aggrieved	407
i	408
have	408
not	408
got	408
wind	408
of	408
any	408
host	408
approaching	408
about	408
which	408
i	408
would	408
warn	408
you	409
nor	409

there	409
any	409
matter	409
of	409
public	409
moment	409
on	409
which	409
i	409
would	409
speak	409
my	410
grieveance	410
is	410
purely	410
personal	410
and	410
turns	410
on	410
two	410
great	410
misfortunes	410
which	411
have	411
fallen	411
upon	411
my	411
house	411
the	411
first	411
of	411
these	411
is	411
the	411
loss	411
of	411
my	412
excellent	412
father	412
who	412
was	412
chief	412
among	412
all	412
you	412
here	412
present	412
and	412
was	413
like	413
a	413
father	413
to	413
every	413
one	413
of	413
you	413
the	413
second	413
is	413
much	413
more	413
serious	413
and	414
ere	414
long	414
will	414
be	414
the	414
utter	414
ruin	414
of	414
my	414
estate	414
the	414
sons	414
of	414
all	414
the	415
chief	415
men	415
among	415
you	415
are	415
pestering	415
my	415
mother	415
to	415
marry	415
them	415
against	415
her	416
will	416
they	416
are	416
afraid	416
to	416
go	416
to	416
her	416
father	416
icarius	416
asking	416
him	416
to	417
choose	417
the	417
one	417
he	417
likes	417
best	417
and	417
to	417
provide	417
marriage	417
gifts	417
for	417
his	418
daughter	418
but	418
day	418
by	418
day	418
they	418
keep	418
hanging	418
about	418
my	418
father's	418
house	418
sacrificing	419
our	419
oxen	419
sheep	419
and	419
fat	419
goats	419
for	419
their	419
banquets	419
and	419
never	420
giving	420
so	420
much	420
as	420
a	420
thought	420
to	420
the	420
quantity	420
of	420
wine	420
they	420
drink	420
no	421
estate	421
can	421
stand	421
such	421
recklessness	421
we	421
have	421
now	421
no	421
ulysses	421
to	421
ward	421
off	422
harm	422
from	422
our	422
doors	422
and	422
i	422
cannot	422
hold	422
my	422
own	422
against	422
them	422
i	422
shall	423
never	423
all	423
my	423
days	423
be	423
as	423
good	423
a	423
man	423
as	423
he	423
was	423
still	423
i	423
would	423
indeed	424
defend	424
myself	424
if	424
i	424
had	424
power	424
to	424
do	424
so	424
for	424
i	424
cannot	424
stand	424
such	424
treatment	425
any	425
longer	425
my	425
house	425
is	425
being	425
disgraced	425
and	425
ruined	425
have	425
respect	426
therefore	426
to	426
your	426
own	426
consciences	426
and	426
to	426
public	426
opinion	426
fear	427
too	427
the	427
wrath	427

burst	438
into	438

very	439
sorry	439
for	439
him	439

they	439
all	439
sat	439
still	439

the	444

it	444
is	444
your	444

not	444
ours	444
for	444
she	445
is	445
a	445
very	445
artful	445
woman	445
this	445
three	445
years	445
past	445
and	445
close	445
on	445
four	445
she	446
has	446
been	446
driving	446
us	446
out	446
of	446
our	446
minds	446
by	446
encouraging	446
each	446
one	446
of	447
us	447
and	447
sending	447
him	447
messages	447
without	447
meaning	447
one	447
word	447
of	447
what	447
she	447
says	448
and	448
then	448
there	448
was	448
that	448
other	448
trick	448
she	448
played	448
us	448
she	448
set	448
up	448
a	449
great	449
tambour	449
frame	449
in	449
her	449
room	449
and	449
began	449
to	449
work	449
on	449
an	449
enormous	449
piece	450
of	450
fine	450
needlework	450
sweet	450
hearts	450
said	450
she	450
ulysses	450
is	450
indeed	450
dead	451
still	451
do	451
not	451
press	451
me	451
to	451
marry	451
again	451
immediately	451
wait	451
for	451
i	452
would	452
not	452
have	452
skill	452
in	452
needlework	452
perish	452
unrecorded	452
till	452
i	452
have	452
completed	453
a	453
pall	453
for	453
the	453
hero	453
laertes	453
to	453
be	453
in	453
readiness	453
against	453
the	454
time	454
when	454
death	454
shall	454
take	454
him	454
he	454
is	454
very	454
rich	454
and	454
the	454
women	454
of	455
the	455
place	455
will	455
talk	455
if	455
he	455
is	455
laid	455
out	455
without	455
a	455
pall	455
this	457
was	457
what	457
she	457
said	457
and	457
we	457
assented	457
whereon	457
we	457
could	457
see	457
her	457
working	458
on	458
her	458
great	458
web	458
all	458
day	458
long	458
but	458
at	458
night	458
she	458
would	458
unpick	458
the	459
stitches	459
again	459
by	459
torchlight	459
she	459
fooled	459
us	459
in	459
this	459
way	459
for	459
three	459
years	460
and	460
we	460
never	460
found	460
her	460
out	460
but	460
as	460
time	460
wore	460
on	460
and	460
she	460
was	460
now	461
in	461
her	461
fourth	461
year	461
one	461
of	461
her	461
maids	461
who	461
knew	461
what	461
she	461
was	461
doing	461
told	462
us	462
and	462
we	462
caught	462
her	462
in	462
the	462
act	462
of	462
undoing	462
her	462
work	462
so	462
she	462
had	463
to	463
finish	463
it	463
whether	463
she	463
would	463
or	463
no	463
the	463
suitors	463
therefore	463
make	464
you	464
this	464
answer	464
that	464
both	464
you	464
and	464
the	464
achaeans	464
may	464
understand-'send	464
your	465

away	465
and	465

her	465

if	466
she	466
goes	466
on	466
plaguing	467
us	467
much	467
longer	467
with	467
the	467
airs	467

gives	467
herself	467

of	468
the	468
accomplishments	468

has	468
taught	468
her	468
and	468
because	468
she	468
is	468
so	469
clever	469
we	469
never	469
yet	469
heard	469
of	469
such	469
a	469
woman	469
we	469
know	469
all	469
about	469

mycene	470
and	470
the	470
famous	470
women	470

were	470
nothing	470
to	471
your	471
mother	471
any	471
one	471
of	471
them	471
it	471
was	471
not	471
fair	471
of	471
her	471
to	471
treat	471
us	471
in	472
that	472
way	472

as	472
long	472
as	472
she	472
continues	472
in	472
the	472
mind	472
with	472
which	472
heaven	472
has	473
now	473
endowed	473
her	473

we	473
go	473
on	473

up	473
your	473

and	474
i	474
do	474

change	474
for	474
she	474
gets	474
all	474
the	474
honour	474

glory	475
and	475
it	475

you	475
who	475

neither	476

out	511
for	511

with	512

after	512
going	512
through	512
much	512
hardship	512
and	513
losing	513
all	513
his	513
men	513
he	513
should	513
come	513
home	513
again	513
in	513
the	513
twentieth	513
year	514

that	514
no	514

would	514
know	514
him	514
and	514
now	514
all	514
this	514
is	514
coming	514
true	514
eurymachus	516
son	516
of	516
polybus	516
then	516
said	516
go	516
home	516
old	516
man	516
and	516
prophesy	516
to	517
your	517
own	517
children	517
or	517
it	517
may	517
be	517
worse	517
for	517
them	517
i	517
can	517
read	517
these	517
omens	518
myself	518

better	518
than	518
you	518

always	518
flying	518
about	518
in	519
the	519

anything	519
ulysses	520
has	520
died	520
in	520
a	520
far	520
country	520
and	520
it	520
is	520
a	520
pity	520
you	520
are	520
not	520
dead	520
along	521
with	521
him	521
instead	521
of	521
prating	521
here	521
about	521
omens	521
and	521
adding	521
fuel	521
to	522
the	522
anger	522
of	522
telemachus	522
which	522
is	522
fierce	522
enough	522
as	522
it	522
is	522
i	522
suppose	522
you	523
think	523
he	523
will	523
give	523
you	523
something	523
for	523
your	523
family	523
but	523
i	523
tell	523
you	523
and	524
it	524
shall	524
surely	524
be	524
when	524
an	524
old	524
man	524
like	524
you	524
who	524
should	524
know	524
better	525
talks	525
a	525
young	525
one	525
over	525
till	525
he	525
becomes	525
troublesome	525
in	525
the	525
first	526
place	526
his	526
young	526
friend	526
will	526
only	526
fare	526
so	526
much	526
the	526
worse	526
he	526
will	527
take	527
nothing	527
by	527
it	527
for	527
the	527
suitors	527
will	527
prevent	527
this	527
and	527
in	527
the	528
next	528
we	528
will	528
lay	528
a	528
heavier	528
fine	528
sir	528
upon	528
yourself	528
than	528
you	528
will	529
at	529
all	529
like	529
paying	529
for	529
it	529
will	529
bear	529
hardly	529
upon	529
you	529
as	529
for	529
telemachus	530
i	530
warn	530
him	530
in	530
the	530
presence	530
of	530
you	530
all	530
to	530
send	530
his	530
mother	530
back	531
to	531
her	531
father	531
who	531
will	531
find	531
her	531
a	531
husband	531
and	531
provide	531
her	531
with	531
all	532
the	532
marriage	532
gifts	532
so	532
dear	532
a	532
daughter	532
may	532
expect	532
till	532
we	532
shall	532
go	533
on	533
harassing	533
him	533
with	533
our	533
suit	533
for	533
we	533
fear	533
no	533
man	533
and	533
care	533
neither	533
for	534
him	534
with	534
all	534
his	534
fine	534
speeches	534
nor	534
for	534
any	534
fortune-telling	534
of	534
yours	535
you	535
may	535
preach	535
as	535
much	535
as	535
you	535
please	535
but	535
we	535
shall	535
only	535
hate	535
you	536
the	536
more	536
we	536
shall	536
go	536
back	536
and	536
continue	536
to	536
eat	536
up	536
telemachus's	536
estate	537
without	537
paying	537
him	537
till	537
such	537
time	537
as	537
his	537
mother	537
leaves	537
off	537
tormenting	538
us	538
by	538
keeping	538
us	538
day	538
after	538
day	538
on	538
the	538
tiptoe	538
of	538
expectation	538
each	539
vying	539
with	539
the	539
other	539
in	539
his	539
suit	539
for	539
a	539
prize	539
of	539
such	539
rare	539
perfection	539
besides	540
we	540
cannot	540
go	540
after	540
the	540
other	540
women	540
whom	540
we	540
should	540
marry	540
in	540
due	541
course	541
but	541
for	541
the	541
way	541
in	541
which	541
she	541
treats	541
us	541
then	543
telemachus	543
said	543
eurymachus	543
and	543
you	543
other	543
suitors	543
i	543
shall	543
say	544
no	544
more	544
and	544
entreat	544
you	544
no	544
further	544
for	544
the	544
gods	544
and	544
the	544
people	544
of	545

now	545
know	545
my	545
story	545
give	545
me	545
then	545
a	545
ship	545
and	545
a	545
crew	545
of	545
twenty	545
men	546
to	546
take	546
me	546
hither	546
and	546
thither	546
and	546
i	546
will	546
go	546
to	546
sparta	546
and	546
to	546
pylos	547
in	547
quest	547
of	547
my	547
father	547
who	547
has	547
so	547
long	547
been	547
missing	547
some	547
one	547
may	548
tell	548
me	548
something	548
or	548
and	548
people	548
often	548
hear	548
things	548
in	548
this	548
way	548
some	549
heaven-sent	549
message	549
may	549
direct	549
me	549
if	549
i	549
can	549
hear	549
of	549
him	549
as	549
alive	549
and	550
on	550
his	550
way	550
home	550
i	550
will	550
put	550
up	550
with	550
the	550
waste	550
you	550
suitors	550
will	550
make	551
for	551
yet	551
another	551
twelve	551
months	551
if	551
on	551
the	551
other	551
hand	551
i	551
hear	551
of	551
his	552
death	552
i	552
will	552
return	552
at	552
once	552
celebrate	552
his	552
funeral	552
rites	552
with	552
all	553
due	553
pomp	553
build	553
a	553
barrow	553
to	553
his	553
memory	553
and	553
make	553
my	553
mother	553
marry	553
again	554
with	556
these	556
words	556
he	556
sat	556
down	556
and	556
mentor	556
who	556
had	556
been	556
a	556
friend	556
of	556
ulysses	557
and	557
had	557
been	557
left	557
in	557
charge	557
of	557
everything	557
with	557
full	557
authority	557
over	558
the	558
servants	558
rose	558
to	558
speak	558
he	558
then	558
plainly	558
and	558
in	558
all	558
honesty	558
addressed	559
them	559
thus	559
hear	561
me	561
men	561
of	561
ithaca	561
i	561
hope	561
that	561
you	561
may	561
never	561
have	561
a	561
kind	561
and	561
well-disposed	562
ruler	562
any	562
more	562
nor	562
one	562
who	562
will	562
govern	562
you	562
equitably	562
i	563
hope	563
that	563
all	563
your	563
chiefs	563
henceforward	563
may	563
be	563
cruel	563
and	563
unjust	563
for	564
there	564
is	564
not	564
one	564
of	564
you	564
but	564
has	564
forgotten	564
ulysses	564
who	564
ruled	564
you	564
as	565
though	565
he	565
were	565
your	565
father	565
i	565
am	565
not	565
half	565
so	565
angry	565
with	565
the	565
suitors	565
for	566
if	566
they	566
choose	566
to	566
do	566
violence	566
in	566
the	566
naughtiness	566
of	566
their	566
hearts	566
and	567
wager	567
their	567
heads	567
that	567
ulysses	567
will	567
not	567
return	567
they	567
can	567
take	567
the	568
high	568
hand	568
and	568
eat	568
up	568
his	568
estate	568
but	568
as	568
for	568
you	568
others	568
i	568
am	568
shocked	568
at	569
the	569
way	569
in	569
which	569
you	569
all	569
sit	569
still	569
without	569
even	569
trying	569
to	569
stop	569
such	570
scandalous	570
goings	570
on-which	570
you	570
could	570
do	570
if	570
you	570
chose	570
for	570
you	570
are	571
many	571
and	571
they	571
are	571
few	571
leiocritus	573
son	573
of	573
evenor	573
answered	573
him	573
saying	573
mentor	573
what	573
folly	573
is	574
all	574
this	574
that	574
you	574
should	574
set	574
the	574
people	574
to	574
stay	574
us	574
it	574
is	574
a	574
hard	574
thing	575
for	575
one	575
man	575
to	575
fight	575
with	575
many	575
about	575
his	575
victuals	575
even	575
though	575
ulysses	576
himself	576
were	576
to	576
set	576
upon	576
us	576
while	576
we	576
are	576
feasting	576
in	576
his	576
house	576
and	577
do	577
his	577
best	577
to	577
oust	577
us	577
his	577
wife	577
who	577
wants	577
him	577
back	577
so	577
very	577
badly	577
would	578
have	578
small	578
cause	578
for	578
rejoicing	578
and	578
his	578
blood	578
would	578
be	578
upon	578
his	579
own	579
head	579
if	579
he	579
fought	579
against	579
such	579
great	579
odds	579
there	579
is	579
no	579
sense	579
in	580
what	580
you	580
have	580
been	580
saying	580
now	580
therefore	580
do	580
you	580
people	580
go	580
about	580
your	581
business	581
and	581
let	581
his	581
father's	581
old	581
friends	581
mentor	581
and	581
halitherses	581
speed	582
this	582
boy	582
on	582
his	582
journey	582
if	582
he	582
goes	582
at	582
all	582
which	582
i	582
do	582
not	582
think	582
he	583
will	583
for	583
he	583
is	583
more	583
likely	583
to	583
stay	583
where	583
he	583
is	583
till	583
some	583
one	583
comes	583
and	584
tells	584
him	584
something	584
on	586
this	586
he	586
broke	586
up	586
the	586
assembly	586
and	586
every	586
man	586
went	586
back	586
to	586
his	586
own	586
abode	587
while	587
the	587
suitors	587
returned	587
to	587
the	587
house	587
of	587
ulysses	587
then	589
telemachus	589
went	589
all	589
alone	589
by	589
the	589
sea	589
side	589
washed	589
his	589
hands	589
in	589
the	590
grey	590
waves	590
and	590
prayed	590
to	590
minerva	590
hear	592
me	592
he	592
cried	592
you	592
god	592
who	592
visited	592
me	592
yesterday	592
and	592
bade	592
me	592
sail	593
the	593
seas	593
in	593
search	593
of	593
my	593
father	593
who	593
has	593
so	593
long	593
been	593
missing	593
i	594
would	594
obey	594
you	594
but	594
the	594
achaeans	594
and	594
more	594
particularly	594
the	594
wicked	594
suitors	595
are	595
hindering	595
me	595
that	595
i	595
cannot	595
do	595
so	595
as	597
he	597
thus	597
prayed	597
minerva	597
came	597
close	597
up	597
to	597
him	597
in	597
the	597
likeness	597
and	597
with	598
the	598
voice	598
of	598
mentor	598
telemachus	598
said	598
she	598
if	598
you	598
are	598
made	598
of	599
the	599
same	599
stuff	599
as	599
your	599
father	599
you	599
will	599
be	599
neither	599
fool	599
nor	599
coward	599
henceforward	600
for	600
ulysses	600
never	600
broke	600
his	600
word	600
nor	600
left	600
his	600
work	600
half	600
done	601
if	601
then	601
you	601
take	601
after	601
him	601
your	601
voyage	601
will	601
not	601
be	601
fruitless	601
but	602
unless	602
you	602
have	602
the	602
blood	602
of	602
ulysses	602
and	602
of	602
penelope	602
in	602
your	602
veins	602
i	603
see	603
no	603
likelihood	603
of	603
your	603
succeeding	603
sons	603

seldom	603
as	603
good	603
men	603
as	604
their	604
fathers	604
they	604
are	604
generally	604
worse	604
not	604
better	604
still	604
as	604
you	605
are	605
not	605
going	605

either	605
fool	605

entirely	606
without	606
some	606
share	606
of	606
your	606
father's	606
wise	606
discernment	606
i	607
look	607
with	607
hope	607
upon	607
your	607

you	607
never	607

neither	608
sense	608
nor	609
virtue	609
and	609
give	609
no	609

to	609
the	609

shortly	610
fall	610
on	610
one	610

told	622
him	622

singeing	623
pigs	623
in	623
the	623
outer	623
court	623
antinous	623
came	623
up	624
to	624
him	624
at	624
once	624
and	624
laughed	624
as	624
he	624
took	624
his	624
hand	624
in	624
his	624
own	624
saying	624
telemachus	625
my	625
fine	625
fire-eater	625
bear	625
no	625
more	625
ill	625
blood	625
neither	625
in	625
word	626
nor	626
deed	626
but	626
eat	626
and	626
drink	626
with	626
us	626
as	626
you	626
used	626
to	626
do	626
the	626
achaeans	626
will	627
find	627
you	627
in	627
everything	627
a	627
ship	627
and	627
a	627
picked	627
crew	627
to	627
boot	627
so	627
that	628
you	628
can	628
set	628
sail	628
for	628
pylos	628
at	628
once	628
and	628
get	628
news	628
of	628
your	628
noble	628
father	629
antinous	631
answered	631
telemachus	631
i	631
cannot	631
eat	631
in	631
peace	631
nor	631
take	631
pleasure	632
of	632
any	632
kind	632
with	632
such	632
men	632
as	632
you	632
are	632
was	632
it	632
not	632
enough	632
that	632
you	633
should	633
waste	633
so	633
much	633
good	633
property	633
of	633
mine	633
while	633
i	633
was	633
yet	633
a	633
boy	633
now	634
that	634
i	634
am	634
older	634
and	634
know	634
more	634
about	634
it	634
i	634
am	634
also	634
stronger	634
and	634
whether	635
here	635
among	635
this	635
people	635
or	635
by	635
going	635
to	635
pylos	635
i	635
will	635
do	635
you	635
all	636
the	636
harm	636
i	636
can	636
i	636
shall	636
go	636
and	636
my	636
going	636
will	636
not	636
be	636
in	636
vain	636
though	636
thanks	637
to	637
you	637
suitors	637
i	637
have	637
neither	637
ship	637
nor	637
crew	637
of	637
my	637
own	637
and	637
must	638
be	638
passenger	638
not	638
captain	638
as	640
he	640
spoke	640
he	640
snatched	640
his	640
hand	640
from	640
that	640
of	640
antinous	640
meanwhile	640
the	641
others	641
went	641
on	641
getting	641
dinner	641
ready	641
about	641
the	641
buildings	641
jeering	641
at	642
him	642
tauntingly	642
as	642
they	642
did	642
so	642
telemachus	644
said	644
one	644
youngster	644
means	644
to	644
be	644
the	644
death	644
of	644
us	644
i	644
suppose	645
he	645
thinks	645
he	645
can	645
bring	645
friends	645
to	645
help	645
him	645
from	645
pylos	645
or	645
again	646
from	646
sparta	646
where	646
he	646
seems	646
bent	646
on	646
going	646
or	646
will	646
he	646
go	646
to	646
ephyra	647
as	647
well	647
for	647
poison	647
to	647
put	647
in	647
our	647
wine	647
and	647
kill	647
us	647
another	649
said	649
perhaps	649
if	649
telemachus	649
goes	649
on	649
board	649
ship	649
he	649
will	649
be	649
like	650
his	650
father	650
and	650
perish	650
far	650
from	650
his	650
friends	650
in	650
this	650
case	650
we	650
should	650
have	651
plenty	651
to	651
do	651
for	651
we	651
could	651
then	651
divide	651
up	651
his	651
property	651
amongst	651
us	652
as	652
for	652
the	652
house	652
we	652
can	652
let	652
his	652
mother	652
and	652
the	652
man	652
who	652
marries	652
her	653
have	653
that	653
this	655
was	655
how	655
they	655
talked	655
but	655
telemachus	655
went	655
down	655
into	655
the	655
lofty	655
and	656
spacious	656
store-room	656
where	656
his	656
father's	656
treasure	656
of	656
gold	656
and	656
bronze	656
lay	657
heaped	657
up	657
upon	657
the	657
floor	657
and	657
where	657
the	657
linen	657
and	657
spare	657
clothes	657
were	658
kept	658
in	658
open	658
chests	658
here	658
too	658
there	658
was	658
a	658
store	658
of	658
fragrant	658
olive	659
oil	659
while	659
casks	659
of	659
old	659
well-ripened	659
wine	659
unblended	659
and	659
fit	659
for	660
a	660
god	660
to	660
drink	660
were	660
ranged	660
against	660
the	660
wall	660
in	660
case	660
ulysses	660
should	660
come	661
home	661
again	661
after	661
all	661
the	661
room	661
was	661
closed	661
with	661
well-made	661
doors	661
opening	662
in	662
the	662
middle	662
moreover	662
the	662
faithful	662
old	662
house-keeper	662
euryclea	662
daughter	663
of	663
ops	663
the	663
son	663
of	663
pisenor	663
was	663
in	663
charge	663
of	663
everything	663
both	663
night	664
and	664
day	664
telemachus	664
called	664
her	664
to	664
the	664
store-room	664
and	664
said	664
nurse	666
draw	666
me	666
off	666
some	666
of	666
the	666
best	666
wine	666
you	666
have	666
after	666
what	666
you	666
are	667
keeping	667
for	667
my	667
father's	667
own	667
drinking	667
in	667
case	667
poor	667
man	667
he	667
should	667
escape	668
death	668
and	668
find	668
his	668
way	668
home	668
again	668
after	668
all	668
let	668
me	668
have	668
twelve	668
jars	669
and	669
see	669
that	669
they	669
all	669
have	669
lids	669
also	669
fill	669
me	669
some	669
well-sewn	669
leathern	670
bags	670
with	670
barley	670
meal	670
about	670
twenty	670
measures	670
in	670
all	670

these	671
things	671
put	671
together	671
at	671
once	671
and	671

nothing	671
about	671
it	671
i	671
will	671
take	672
everything	672
away	672
this	672
evening	672
as	672
soon	672
as	672
my	672
mother	672
has	672
gone	672
upstairs	672
for	673
the	673
night	673
i	673
am	673
going	673
to	673
sparta	673
and	673
to	673
pylos	673
to	673
see	673
if	673
i	673
can	673
hear	673
anything	674
about	674
the	674
return	674
of	674
my	674
dear	674
father	674
when	676
euryclea	676
heard	676
this	676
she	676
began	676
to	676
cry	676
and	676
spoke	676
fondly	676
to	676
him	676
saying	677
my	677
dear	677
child	677
what	677
ever	677
can	677
have	677
put	677
such	677
notion	677
as	677
that	677
into	678
your	678
head	678
where	678
in	678
the	678
world	678
do	678
you	678
want	678
to	678
go	678
to	678
you	678
who	678
are	679
the	679
one	679
hope	679
of	679
the	679
house	679
your	679
poor	679
father	679
is	679
dead	679
and	679
gone	679
in	679
some	680
foreign	680
country	680
nobody	680
knows	680
where	680
and	680
as	680
soon	680
as	680
your	680
back	680
is	681
turned	681
these	681
wicked	681
ones	681
here	681
will	681
be	681
scheming	681
to	681
get	681
you	681
put	681
out	681
of	682
the	682
way	682
and	682
will	682
share	682
all	682
your	682
possessions	682
among	682
themselves	682
stay	683
where	683
you	683
are	683
among	683
your	683
own	683
people	683
and	683
do	683
not	683
go	683
wandering	683
and	684
worrying	684
your	684
life	684
out	684
on	684
the	684
barren	684
ocean	684
fear	686
not	686
nurse	686
answered	686
telemachus	686
my	686
scheme	686
is	686
not	686
without	686
heaven's	687
sanction	687
but	687
swear	687
that	687
you	687
will	687
say	687
nothing	687
about	687
all	687
this	687
to	688
my	688
mother	688
till	688
i	688
have	688
been	688
away	688
some	688
ten	688
or	688
twelve	688
days	688
unless	688
she	689
hears	689
of	689
my	689
having	689
gone	689
and	689
asks	689
you	689
for	689
i	689
do	689
not	689
want	689
her	689
to	689
spoil	690
her	690
beauty	690
by	690
crying	690
the	692
old	692
woman	692
swore	692
most	692
solemnly	692
that	692
she	692
would	692
not	692
and	692
when	692
she	692
had	693
completed	693
her	693
oath	693
she	693
began	693
drawing	693
off	693
the	693
wine	693
into	693
jars	693
and	694
getting	694
the	694
barley	694
meal	694
into	694
the	694
bags	694
while	694
telemachus	694
went	694
back	694
to	695
the	695
suitors	695
then	697
minerva	697
bethought	697
her	697
of	697
another	697
matter	697
she	697
took	697
his	697
shape	697
and	698
went	698
round	698
the	698
town	698
to	698
each	698
one	698
of	698
the	698
crew	698
telling	698
them	698
to	698
meet	698
at	699
the	699
ship	699
by	699
sundown	699
she	699
went	699
also	699
to	699
noemon	699
son	699
of	699
phronius	699
and	699
asked	700
him	700
to	700
let	700
her	700
have	700
a	700
ship	700
which	700
he	700
was	700
very	700
ready	700
to	700
do	700
when	700
the	701
sun	701
had	701
set	701
and	701
darkness	701
was	701
over	701
all	701
the	701
land	701
she	701
got	701
the	701
ship	701
into	702
the	702
water	702
put	702
all	702
the	702
tackle	702
on	702
board	702
her	702
that	702
ships	702
generally	702
carry	703
and	703
stationed	703
her	703
at	703
the	703
end	703
of	703
the	703
harbour	703
presently	703
the	703
crew	704
came	704
up	704
and	704
the	704
goddess	704
spoke	704
encouragingly	704
to	704
each	704
of	704
them	704
furthermore	706
she	706
went	706
to	706
the	706
house	706
of	706
ulysses	706
and	706
threw	706
the	706
suitors	706
into	707
a	707
deep	707
slumber	707
she	707
caused	707
their	707
drink	707
to	707
fuddle	707
them	707
and	707
made	707
them	708
drop	708
their	708
cups	708
from	708
their	708
hands	708
so	708
that	708
instead	708
of	708
sitting	708
over	709
their	709
wine	709
they	709
went	709
back	709
into	709
the	709
town	709
to	709
sleep	709
with	709
their	709
eyes	710
heavy	710
and	710
full	710
of	710
drowsiness	710
then	710
she	710
took	710
the	710
form	710
and	710
voice	710
of	711
mentor	711
and	711
called	711
telemachus	711
to	711
come	711
outside	711
telemachus	713
said	713
she	713
the	713
men	713
are	713
on	713
board	713
and	713
at	713
their	713
oars	713
waiting	713
for	714
you	714
to	714
give	714
your	714
orders	714
so	714
make	714
haste	714
and	714
let	714
us	714
be	714
off	714
on	716
this	716
she	716
led	716
the	716
way	716
while	716
telemachus	716
followed	716
in	716
her	716
steps	716
when	716
they	717
got	717
to	717
the	717
ship	717
they	717
found	717
the	717
crew	717
waiting	717
by	717
the	717
water	717
side	717
and	718
telemachus	718
said	718
now	718
my	718
men	718
help	718
me	718
to	718
get	718
the	718
stores	718
on	718
board	718
they	719
are	719
all	719
put	719
together	719
in	719
the	719
cloister	719
and	719
my	719
mother	719
does	719
not	719
know	720
anything	720
about	720
it	720
nor	720
any	720
of	720
the	720
maid	720
servants	720
except	720
one	720
with	722
these	722
words	722
he	722
led	722
the	722
way	722
and	722
the	722
others	722
followed	722
after	722
when	722
they	723
had	723
brought	723
the	723
things	723
as	723
he	723
told	723
them	723
telemachus	723
went	723
on	723
board	723
minerva	724
going	724
before	724
him	724
and	724
taking	724
her	724
seat	724
in	724
the	724
stern	724
of	724
the	724
vessel	724
while	725
telemachus	725
sat	725
beside	725
her	725
then	725
the	725
men	725
loosed	725
the	725
hawsers	725
and	725
took	726
their	726
places	726
on	726
the	726
benches	726
minerva	726
sent	726
them	726
a	726
fair	726
wind	726
from	726
the	727
west	727
that	727
whistled	727
over	727
the	727
deep	727
blue	727
waves	727
whereon	727
telemachus	727
told	728
them	728
to	728
catch	728
hold	728
of	728
the	728
ropes	728
and	728
hoist	728
sail	728
and	728
they	728
did	728
as	729
he	729
told	729
them	729
they	729
set	729
the	729
mast	729
in	729
its	729
socket	729
in	729
the	729
cross	729
plank	729
raised	730
it	730
and	730
made	730

telemachus	755
followed	755
her	755
presently	755
she	755
said	755
telemachus	756
you	756
must	756
not	756
be	756
in	756
the	756
least	756
shy	756
or	756
nervous	756
you	756
have	756
taken	757
this	757
voyage	757
to	757
try	757
and	757
find	757
out	757
where	757
your	757
father	757
is	757
buried	757
and	758
how	758
he	758
came	758
by	758
his	758
end	758
so	758
go	758
straight	758
up	758
to	758
nestor	758
that	758
we	758
may	758
see	759
what	759
he	759
has	759
got	759
to	759
tell	759
us	759
beg	759
of	759
him	759
to	759
speak	759
the	759
truth	759
and	759
he	760
will	760
tell	760
no	760
lies	760
for	760
he	760
is	760
an	760
excellent	760
person	760
but	762
how	762
mentor	762
replied	762
telemachus	762
dare	762
i	762
go	762
up	762
to	762
nestor	762
and	762
how	763
am	763
i	763
to	763
address	763
him	763
i	763
have	763
never	763
yet	763
been	763
used	763
to	763
holding	763
long	763
conversations	764
with	764
people	764
and	764
am	764
ashamed	764
to	764
begin	764
questioning	764
one	764
who	765
is	765
so	765
much	765
older	765
than	765
myself	765
some	767
things	767
telemachus	767
answered	767
minerva	767
will	767
be	767
suggested	767
to	767
you	768
by	768
your	768
own	768
instinct	768
and	768
heaven	768
will	768
prompt	768
you	768
further	768
for	768
i	769
am	769
assured	769
that	769
the	769
gods	769
have	769
been	769
with	769
you	769
from	769
the	769
time	769
of	769
your	769
birth	770
until	770
now	770
she	772
then	772
went	772
quickly	772
on	772
and	772
telemachus	772
followed	772
in	772
her	772
steps	772
till	772
they	773
reached	773
the	773
place	773
where	773
the	773

there	774
they	774
found	774

were	776
cooking	776
when	776
they	776
saw	777
the	777
strangers	777
they	777
crowded	777
round	777
them	777
took	777
them	777
by	777
the	777
hand	777
and	777
bade	778
them	778
take	778
their	778
places	778
nestor's	778
son	778
pisistratus	778
at	778
once	778
offered	778
his	779
hand	779
to	779
each	779
of	779
them	779
and	779
seated	779
them	779
on	779
some	779
soft	779
sheepskins	779
that	780
were	780
lying	780
on	780
the	780
sands	780
near	780
his	780
father	780
and	780
his	780
brother	780
thrasymedes	780
then	781
he	781
gave	781
them	781
their	781
portions	781
of	781
the	781
inward	781
meats	781
and	781
poured	781

into	782
a	782

her	783
at	783
the	783
same	783
time	783
offer	785
a	785
prayer	785
sir	785
said	785
he	785
to	785
king	785
neptune	785
for	785
it	785
is	785
his	785
feast	785
that	786
you	786
are	786
joining	786
when	786
you	786
have	786

your	786
drink-offering	786
pass	787
the	787
cup	787
to	787
your	787
friend	787
that	787
he	787
may	787
do	787
so	787
also	787
i	787
doubt	787
not	787
that	787
he	788
too	788
lifts	788
his	788
hands	788
in	788
prayer	788
for	788
man	788
cannot	788
live	788
without	788
god	788
in	789
the	789

still	789
he	789
is	789
younger	789
than	789
you	789

is	789
much	789
of	789
an	789

it	792
very	792
right	792

were	842
to	842
stay	842
here	842
and	842
question	842
me	842
for	842
five	842
years	842
or	842
even	842
six	842
i	843
could	843
not	843
tell	843
you	843
all	843
that	843
the	843
achaeans	843
suffered	843
and	843
you	843
would	843
turn	844
homeward	844
weary	844
of	844
my	844
tale	844
before	844
it	844
ended	844
nine	844
long	844
years	844
did	844
we	845
try	845
every	845
kind	845
of	845
stratagem	845
but	845
the	845
hand	845
of	845
heaven	845
was	845
against	845
us	846
during	846
all	846
this	846
time	846
there	846
was	846
no	846
one	846
who	846
could	846
compare	846
with	846
your	846
father	847
in	847
subtlety	847
if	847
indeed	847
you	847
are	847
his	847
son	847
i	847
can	847
hardly	847
believe	847
my	848
eyes	848
and	848
you	848
talk	848
just	848
like	848
him	848
too	848
no	848
one	848
would	848
say	848
that	848
people	848
of	849
such	849
different	849
ages	849
could	849
speak	849
so	849
much	849
alike	849
he	849
and	849
i	849
never	849
had	849
any	850
kind	850
of	850
difference	850
from	850
first	850
to	850
last	850
neither	850
in	850
camp	850
nor	850
council	850
but	851
in	851
singleness	851
of	851
heart	851
and	851
purpose	851
we	851
advised	851
the	851
argives	851
how	851
all	852
might	852
be	852
ordered	852
for	852
the	852
best	852
when	854
however	854
we	854
had	854
sacked	854
the	854
city	854
of	854
priam	854
and	854
were	854
setting	854
sail	854
in	855
our	855
ships	855
as	855
heaven	855
had	855
dispersed	855
us	855
then	855
jove	855
saw	855
fit	855
to	855
vex	855
the	856
argives	856
on	856
their	856
homeward	856
voyage	856
for	856
they	856
had	856
not	856
all	856
been	856
either	856
wise	857
or	857
understanding	857
and	857
hence	857
many	857
came	857
to	857
a	857
bad	857
end	857
through	857
the	857
displeasure	858
of	858
jove's	858
daughter	858
minerva	858
who	858
brought	858
about	858
a	858
quarrel	858
between	859
the	859
two	859
sons	859
of	859
atreus	859
the	861
sons	861
of	861
atreus	861
called	861
a	861
meeting	861
which	861
was	861
not	861
as	861
it	861
should	861
be	861
for	862
it	862
was	862
sunset	862
and	862
the	862
achaeans	862
were	862
heavy	862
with	862
wine	862
when	862
they	862
explained	863
why	863
they	863
had	863
called	863
the	863
people	863
together	863
it	863
seemed	863
that	863
menelaus	864
was	864
for	864
sailing	864
homeward	864
at	864
once	864
and	864
this	864
displeased	864
agamemnon	864
who	865
thought	865
that	865
we	865
should	865
wait	865
till	865
we	865
had	865
offered	865
hecatombs	865
to	865
appease	865
the	866
anger	866
of	866
minerva	866
fool	866
that	866
he	866
was	866
he	866
might	866
have	866
known	866
that	866
he	866
would	867
not	867
prevail	867
with	867
her	867
for	867
when	867
the	867
gods	867
have	867
made	867
up	867
their	867
minds	867
they	868
do	868
not	868
change	868
them	868
lightly	868
so	868
the	868
two	868
stood	868
bandying	868
hard	868
words	868
whereon	869
the	869
achaeans	869
sprang	869
to	869
their	869
feet	869
with	869
a	869
cry	869
that	869
rent	869
the	869
air	870
and	870
were	870
of	870
two	870
minds	870
as	870
to	870
what	870
they	870
should	870
do	870
that	872
night	872
we	872
rested	872
and	872
nursed	872
our	872
anger	872
for	872
jove	872
was	872
hatching	872
mischief	873
against	873
us	873
but	873
in	873
the	873
morning	873
some	873
of	873
us	873
drew	873
our	873
ships	873
into	874
the	874
water	874
and	874
put	874
our	874
goods	874
with	874
our	874
women	874
on	874
board	874
while	874
the	874
rest	875
about	875
half	875
in	875
number	875
stayed	875
behind	875
with	875
agamemnon	875
we	875
the	875
other	876
half	876
embarked	876
and	876
sailed	876
and	876
the	876
ships	876
went	876
well	876
for	876
heaven	876
had	877
smoothed	877
the	877
sea	877
when	877
we	877
reached	877
tenedos	877
we	877
offered	877
sacrifices	877
to	878
the	878
gods	878
for	878
we	878
were	878
longing	878
to	878
get	878
home	878
cruel	878
jove	878
however	878
did	879
not	879
yet	879
mean	879
that	879
we	879
should	879
do	879
so	879
and	879
raised	879
a	879
second	879
quarrel	879
in	880
the	880
course	880
of	880
which	880
some	880
among	880
us	880
turned	880
their	880
ships	880
back	880
again	880
and	881
sailed	881
away	881
under	881
ulysses	881
to	881
make	881
their	881
peace	881
with	881
agamemnon	881
but	882
i	882
and	882
all	882
the	882
ships	882
that	882
were	882
with	882
me	882
pressed	882
forward	882
for	882
i	882
saw	883
that	883
mischief	883
was	883
brewing	883
the	883
son	883
of	883
tydeus	883
went	883
on	883
also	883
with	883
me	884
and	884
his	884
crews	884
with	884
him	884
later	884
on	884
menelaus	884
joined	884
us	884
at	884
lesbos	884
and	885
found	885
us	885
making	885
up	885
our	885
minds	885
about	885
our	885
course	885
for	885
we	885
did	885
not	885
know	886
whether	886
to	886
go	886
outside	886
chios	886
by	886
the	886
island	886
of	886
psyra	886
keeping	886
this	886
to	887
our	887
left	887
or	887
inside	887
chios	887
over	887
against	887
the	887
stormy	887
headland	887
of	887
mimas	888
so	888
we	888
asked	888
heaven	888
for	888
a	888
sign	888
and	888
were	888
shown	888
one	888
to	888
the	888
effect	888
that	889
we	889
should	889
be	889
soonest	889
out	889
of	889
danger	889
if	889
we	889
headed	889
our	889
ships	889
across	889
the	890
open	890
sea	890
to	890
euboea	890
this	890
we	890
therefore	890
did	890
and	890
a	890
fair	890
wind	890
sprang	890
up	891
which	891
gave	891
us	891
a	891
quick	891
passage	891
during	891
the	891
night	891
to	891
geraestus	891
where	891
we	892
offered	892
many	892
sacrifices	892
to	892
neptune	892
for	892
having	892
helped	892
us	892
so	892
far	892
on	893
our	893
way	893
four	893
days	893
later	893
diomed	893
and	893
his	893
men	893
stationed	893
their	893
ships	893
in	894
argos	894
but	894
i	894
held	894
on	894
for	894
pylos	894
and	894
the	894
wind	894
never	894
fell	894
light	894
from	894
the	895
day	895
when	895
heaven	895
first	895
made	895
it	895
fair	895
for	895
me	895
therefore	897
my	897
dear	897
young	897
friend	897
i	897
returned	897
without	897
hearing	897
anything	897
about	898
the	898
others	898
i	898
know	898
neither	898
who	898
got	898
home	898
safely	898
nor	898
who	898
were	898
lost	899
but	899
as	899
in	899
duty	899
bound	899
i	899
will	899
give	899
you	899
without	899
reserve	899
the	899
reports	899
that	900
have	900
reached	900
me	900
since	900
i	900
have	900
been	900
here	900
in	900
my	900
own	900
house	900
they	900
say	901
the	901
myrmidons	901
returned	901
home	901
safely	901
under	901
achilles	901
son	901
neoptolemus	901
so	902
also	902
did	902
the	902
valiant	902
son	902
of	902
poias	902
philoctetes	902
idomeneus	902
again	902
lost	903
no	903
men	903
at	903
sea	903
and	903
all	903
his	903
followers	903
who	903
escaped	903
death	903
in	903
the	903
field	904
got	904
safe	904
home	904
with	904
him	904
to	904
crete	904
no	904
matter	904
how	904
far	904
out	904
of	904
the	904
world	905
you	905
live	905
you	905
will	905
have	905
heard	905
of	905
agamemnon	905
and	905
the	905
bad	905
end	905
he	905
came	906
to	906
at	906
the	906
hands	906
of	906
aegisthus	906
and	906
a	906
fearful	906
reckoning	906
did	906
aegisthus	906
presently	907
pay	907
see	907
what	907
a	907
good	907
thing	907
it	907
is	907
for	907
a	907
man	907
to	907
leave	907
a	907
son	907
behind	908
him	908
to	908
do	908
as	908
orestes	908
did	908
who	908
killed	908
false	908
aegisthus	908
the	908
murderer	908
of	909
his	909
noble	909
father	909
you	909
too	909
then	909
for	909
you	909
are	909
a	909
tall	909
smart-looking	909
fellow	910
show	910
your	910
mettle	910
and	910
make	910
yourself	910
a	910
name	910
in	910
story	910
nestor	912
son	912
of	912
neleus	912
answered	912
telemachus	912
honour	912
to	912
the	912
achaean	912
name	913
the	913
achaeans	913
applaud	913
orestes	913
and	913
his	913
name	913
will	913
live	913
through	913
all	914
time	914
for	914
he	914
has	914
avenged	914
his	914
father	914
nobly	914
would	914
that	914
heaven	914
might	914
grant	915
me	915
to	915
do	915
like	915
vengeance	915
on	915
the	915
insolence	915
of	915
the	915
wicked	915
suitors	915
who	916
are	916
ill	916
treating	916
me	916
and	916
plotting	916
my	916
ruin	916
but	916
the	916
gods	916
have	916
no	916
such	917
happiness	917
in	917
store	917
for	917
me	917
and	917
for	917
my	917
father	917
so	917
we	917
must	917
bear	917
it	918
as	918
best	918
we	918
may	918
my	920
friend	920
said	920
nestor	920
now	920
that	920
you	920
remind	920
me	920
i	920
remember	920
to	920
have	920
heard	921
that	921
your	921
mother	921
has	921
many	921
suitors	921
who	921
are	921
ill	921
disposed	921
towards	921
you	922
and	922
are	922
making	922
havoc	922
of	922
your	922
estate	922
do	922
you	922
submit	922
to	922
this	922
tamely	922
or	923
are	923
public	923
feeling	923
and	923
the	923
voice	923
of	923
heaven	923
against	923
you	923
who	923
knows	923
but	924
what	924
ulysses	924
may	924
come	924
back	924
after	924
all	924
and	924
pay	924
these	924
scoundrels	924
in	925
full	925
either	925
single-handed	925
or	925
with	925
a	925
force	925
of	925
achaeans	925
behind	925
him	925
if	926
minerva	926
were	926
to	926
take	926
as	926
great	926
a	926
liking	926
to	926
you	926
as	926
she	926
did	926
to	926
ulysses	926
when	927
we	927
were	927
fighting	927
before	927
troy	927
for	927
i	927
never	927
yet	927
saw	927
the	927
gods	927
so	927
openly	928
fond	928
of	928
any	928
one	928
as	928
minerva	928
then	928
was	928
of	928
your	928
father	928
if	928
she	928
would	929
take	929
as	929
good	929
care	929
of	929
you	929
as	929
she	929
did	929
of	929
him	929
these	929
wooers	929
would	929
soon	930
some	930
of	930
them	930
him	930
forget	930
their	930
wooing	930
telemachus	932
answered	932
i	932
can	932
expect	932
nothing	932
of	932
the	932
kind	932
it	932
would	932
be	932
far	933
too	933
much	933
to	933
hope	933
for	933
i	933
dare	933
not	933
let	933
myself	933
think	933
of	933
it	933
even	933
though	934
the	934
gods	934
themselves	934
willed	934
it	934
no	934
such	934
good	934
fortune	934
could	934
befall	934
me	935
on	937
this	937
minerva	937
said	937
telemachus	937
what	937
are	937
you	937
talking	937
about	937
heaven	937
has	938
a	938
long	938
arm	938
if	938
it	938
is	938
minded	938
to	938
save	938
a	938
man	938
and	938
if	938
it	938
were	938
me	938
i	938
should	939
not	939
care	939
how	939
much	939
i	939
suffered	939
before	939
getting	939
home	939
provided	939
i	940
could	940
be	940
safe	940
when	940
i	940
was	940
once	940
there	940
i	940
would	940
rather	940
this	940
than	940
get	940
home	941
quickly	941
and	941
then	941
be	941
killed	941
in	941
my	941
own	941
house	941
as	941
agamemnon	941
was	941
by	942
the	942
treachery	942
of	942
aegisthus	942
and	942
his	942
wife	942
still	942
death	942
is	942
certain	942
and	943
when	943
a	943
man's	943
hour	943
is	943
come	943
not	943
even	943
the	943
gods	943
can	943
save	943
him	943
no	943
matter	944
how	944
fond	944
they	944
are	944
of	944
him	944
mentor	946
answered	946
telemachus	946
do	946
not	946
let	946
us	946
talk	946
about	946
it	946
any	946
more	946
there	947
is	947
no	947
chance	947
of	947
my	947
father's	947
ever	947
coming	947
back	947
the	947
gods	947
have	947
long	948
since	948
counselled	948
his	948
destruction	948
there	948
is	948
something	948
else	948
however	948
about	949
which	949
i	949
should	949
like	949
to	949
ask	949
nestor	949
for	949
he	949
knows	949
much	949
more	949
than	949
any	950
one	950
else	950
does	950
they	950
say	950
he	950
has	950
reigned	950
for	950
three	950
generations	950
so	950
that	951
it	951
is	951
like	951
talking	951
to	951
an	951
immortal	951
tell	951
me	951
therefore	951
nestor	951
and	952
tell	952
me	952
true	952
how	952
did	952
agamemnon	952
come	952
to	952
die	952
in	952
that	952
way	952
what	952
was	953
menelaus	953
doing	953
and	953
how	953
came	953
false	953
aegisthus	953
to	953
kill	953
so	953
far	953
better	953
a	954
man	954
than	954
himself	954
was	954
menelaus	954
away	954
from	954
achaean	954
argos	954
voyaging	954
elsewhither	955
among	955
mankind	955
that	955
aegisthus	955
took	955
heart	955
and	955
killed	955
agamemnon	955
i	957
will	957
tell	957
you	957
truly	957
answered	957
nestor	957
and	957
indeed	957
you	957
have	957
yourself	957
divined	958
how	958
it	958
all	958
happened	958
if	958
menelaus	958
when	958
he	958
got	958
back	958
from	958
troy	958
had	959
found	959
aegisthus	959
still	959
alive	959
in	959
his	959
house	959
there	959
would	959
have	959
been	959
no	960
barrow	960
heaped	960
up	960
for	960
him	960
not	960
even	960
when	960
he	960
was	960
dead	960
but	960
he	960
would	960
have	961
been	961
thrown	961
outside	961
the	961
city	961
to	961
dogs	961
and	961
vultures	961
and	961
not	961
a	961
woman	962
would	962
have	962
mourned	962
him	962
for	962
he	962
had	962
done	962
a	962
deed	962
of	962
great	962
wickedness	962
but	963
we	963
were	963
over	963
there	963
fighting	963
hard	963
at	963
troy	963
and	963
aegisthus	963
who	963
was	963
taking	964
his	964
ease	964
quietly	964
in	964
the	964
heart	964
of	964
argos	964
cajoled	964
agamemnon's	964
wife	965
clytemnestra	965
with	965
incessant	965
flattery	965
at	967
first	967
she	967
would	967
have	967
nothing	967
to	967
do	967
with	967
his	967
wicked	967
scheme	967
for	967
she	968
was	968
of	968
a	968
good	968
natural	968
disposition	968
moreover	968
there	968
was	968
a	968
bard	968
with	968
her	969
to	969
whom	969
agamemnon	969
had	969
given	969
strict	969
orders	969
on	969
setting	969
out	969
for	969
troy	970
that	970
he	970
was	970
to	970
keep	970
guard	970
over	970
his	970
wife	970
but	970
when	970
heaven	970
had	970
counselled	971
her	971
destruction	971
aegisthus	971
thus	971
this	971
bard	971
off	971
to	971
a	971
desert	971
island	972
and	972
left	972
him	972
there	972
for	972
crows	972
and	972
seagulls	972
to	972
batten	972
upon	972
after	972
which	973
she	973
went	973
willingly	973
enough	973
to	973
the	973
house	973
of	973
aegisthus	973
then	973
he	973
offered	974
many	974
burnt	974
sacrifices	974
to	974
the	974
gods	974
and	974
decorated	974
many	974
temples	974
with	975
tapestries	975
and	975
gilding	975
for	975
he	975
had	975
succeeded	975
far	975
beyond	975
his	975
expectations	975
meanwhile	977
menelaus	977
and	977
i	977
were	977
on	977
our	977
way	977
home	977
from	977
troy	977
on	977
good	977
terms	978
with	978
one	978
another	978
when	978
we	978
got	978
to	978
sunium	978
which	978
is	978
the	978
point	978
of	979
athens	979
apollo	979
with	979
his	979
painless	979
shafts	979
killed	979
phrontis	979
the	979
steersman	979
of	980
menelaus	980
ship	980
and	980
never	980
man	980
knew	980
better	980
how	980
to	980
handle	980
a	980
vessel	980
in	981
rough	981
weather	981
so	981
that	981
he	981
died	981
then	981
and	981
there	981
with	981
the	981
helm	981
in	981
his	982
hand	982
and	982
menelaus	982
though	982
very	982
anxious	982
to	982
press	982
forward	982
had	982
to	983
wait	983
in	983
order	983
to	983
bury	983
his	983
comrade	983
and	983
give	983
him	983
his	983
due	983
funeral	983
rites	984
presently	984
when	984
he	984
too	984
could	984
put	984
to	984
sea	984
again	984
and	984
had	984
sailed	984
on	985
as	985
far	985
as	985
the	985
malean	985
heads	985
jove	985
counselled	985
evil	985
against	985
him	985
and	985
made	986
it	986
it	986
blow	986
hard	986
till	986
the	986
waves	986
ran	986
mountains	986
high	986
here	986
he	986
divided	986
his	987
fleet	987
and	987
took	987
the	987

half	987
towards	987
crete	987
where	987
the	987
cydonians	987

stretching	989
out	989
into	989
the	989
sea	989
from	989
a	989

along	990
this	990

was	993
driven	993
on	993
to	993
the	993

wrecked	994
but	994
the	994
crews	994
just	994
managed	994
to	994
save	994
themselves	994
as	994
for	994
the	994
other	995

to	995
egypt	995
where	995
menelaus	996

gold	996
and	996
substance	996
among	996
people	996
of	996
an	996

meanwhile	997
aegisthus	997
here	997
at	997
home	997
plotted	997
his	997
evil	997
deed	997
for	997
seven	998
years	998
after	998
he	998
had	998
killed	998
agamemnon	998
he	998
ruled	998
in	998
mycene	998
and	998
the	999
people	999
were	999
obedient	999
under	999
him	999
but	999
in	999
the	999
eighth	999
year	999
orestes	999
came	1000
back	1000
from	1000
athens	1000
to	1000
be	1000
his	1000
bane	1000
and	1000
killed	1000
the	1000
murderer	1000
of	1000
his	1000
father	1001
then	1001
he	1001
celebrated	1001
the	1001

a	1002

to	1002
the	1002

argos	1002
and	1002
on	1002
that	1002
very	1002
day	1003
menelaus	1003
came	1003
home	1003
with	1003
as	1003
much	1003

as	1003
his	1003
ships	1003
could	1003
carry	1003
take	1005
my	1005
advice	1005
then	1005
and	1005
do	1005
not	1005
go	1005
travelling	1005
about	1005
for	1005
long	1005
so	1005
far	1005
from	1006

such	1006
dangerous	1006
people	1006
in	1006
your	1006

eat	1007
up	1007
everything	1007
you	1007
have	1007
among	1007
them	1007
and	1007
you	1007
will	1007
have	1008
been	1008
on	1008
a	1008
fool's	1008
errand	1008
still	1008
i	1008
should	1008
advise	1008
you	1008
by	1008
all	1008
means	1008
to	1009
go	1009
and	1009
visit	1009
menelaus	1009
who	1009
has	1009
lately	1009
come	1009
off	1009
a	1009
voyage	1009
among	1009
such	1009
distant	1010
peoples	1010
as	1010
no	1010
man	1010
could	1010
ever	1010
hope	1010
to	1010
get	1010
back	1010
from	1010
when	1010
the	1010
winds	1011
had	1011
once	1011
carried	1011
him	1011
so	1011
far	1011
out	1011
of	1011
his	1011
reckoning	1011
even	1011
birds	1011
cannot	1012
fly	1012
the	1012
distance	1012
in	1012
a	1012
twelvemonth	1012
so	1012
vast	1012
and	1012
terrible	1012
are	1012
the	1013
seas	1013
that	1013
they	1013
must	1013
cross	1013
go	1013
to	1013
him	1013
therefore	1013
by	1013
sea	1013
and	1013
take	1013
your	1014
own	1014
men	1014
with	1014
you	1014
or	1014
if	1014
you	1014
would	1014
rather	1014
travel	1014
by	1014
land	1014
you	1014
can	1014
have	1015
a	1015
chariot	1015
you	1015
can	1015
have	1015
horses	1015
and	1015
here	1015
are	1015
my	1015
sons	1015
who	1015
can	1015
escort	1016
you	1016
to	1016
lacedaemon	1016
where	1016
menelaus	1016
lives	1016
beg	1016
of	1016
him	1016
to	1016
speak	1016
the	1017
truth	1017
and	1017
he	1017
will	1017
tell	1017
you	1017
no	1017
lies	1017
for	1017
he	1017
is	1017
an	1017
excellent	1017
person	1017
as	1019
he	1019
spoke	1019
the	1019
sun	1019
set	1019
and	1019
it	1019
came	1019
on	1019
dark	1019
whereon	1019
minerva	1019
said	1019
sir	1020
all	1020
that	1020
you	1020
have	1020
said	1020
is	1020
well	1020
now	1020
however	1020
order	1020
the	1020
tongues	1020
of	1021
the	1021
victims	1021
to	1021
be	1021
cut	1021

that	1021
we	1021
may	1021
make	1021
drink-offerings	1021
to	1022
neptune	1022
and	1022
the	1022
other	1022
immortals	1022
and	1022
then	1022
go	1022
to	1022
bed	1022
for	1022
it	1022
is	1022
bed	1023
time	1023
people	1023
should	1023
go	1023
away	1023
early	1023
and	1023
not	1023
keep	1023
late	1023
hours	1023
at	1023
a	1023
religious	1024
festival	1024
thus	1026
spoke	1026
the	1026
daughter	1026
of	1026
jove	1026
and	1026
they	1026
obeyed	1026
her	1026
saying	1026
men	1026
servants	1026
poured	1027
water	1027
over	1027
the	1027
hands	1027
of	1027
the	1027
guests	1027
while	1027
pages	1027
filled	1027
the	1027
mixing-bowls	1028
with	1028
wine	1028
and	1028
water	1028
and	1028
handed	1028
it	1028
round	1028
after	1028
giving	1028
every	1029
man	1029
his	1029
drink-offering	1029
then	1029
they	1029
threw	1029
the	1029
tongues	1029
of	1029
the	1029
victims	1029
into	1030
the	1030
fire	1030
and	1030
stood	1030
up	1030
to	1030
make	1030
their	1030
drink-offerings	1030
when	1030
they	1030
had	1031
made	1031
their	1031
offerings	1031
and	1031
had	1031
drunk	1031
each	1031

telemachus	1032
were	1032
forgoing	1032
on	1032

nestor	1032
caught	1033
them	1033
up	1033

to	1036
go	1036
on	1036

of	1036
a	1036

do	1036
you	1036
think	1036
i	1036
am	1036
so	1036

everything	1229

so	1229
splendid	1229
that	1229
it	1229
is	1229

seeing	1229
the	1229
palace	1229

olympian	1229
jove	1230
i	1230

have	1235
travelled	1235
much	1235
and	1236

through	1244
the	1244
perfidy	1244
of	1244

a	1248
third	1248
of	1248
what	1248
i	1248
now	1248

so	1248
that	1248
i	1249
had	1249
stayed	1249
at	1249
home	1249
and	1249
all	1249
those	1249

living	1249
who	1249
perished	1249
on	1249
the	1249
plain	1250
of	1250
troy	1250
far	1250
from	1250

sit	1250
here	1250
in	1250
my	1250

for	1251
one	1251

all	1251
of	1251
them	1251
at	1251
times	1251
i	1251
cry	1251
aloud	1251
for	1251
sorrow	1251
but	1251
presently	1251
i	1252
leave	1252
off	1252
again	1252
for	1252
crying	1252
is	1252
cold	1252
comfort	1252
and	1252
one	1252
soon	1252
tires	1252
of	1252
it	1253
yet	1253
grieve	1253
for	1253
these	1253
as	1253
i	1253
may	1253
i	1253
do	1253
so	1253
for	1253
one	1253
man	1253
more	1253
than	1253
for	1253
them	1254
all	1254
i	1254
cannot	1254
even	1254
think	1254
of	1254
him	1254
without	1254
loathing	1254
both	1254
food	1254
and	1254
sleep	1255
so	1255
miserable	1255
does	1255
he	1255
make	1255
me	1255
for	1255
no	1255
one	1255
of	1255
all	1255
the	1255
achaeans	1255
worked	1256
so	1256
hard	1256
or	1256
risked	1256
so	1256
much	1256
as	1256
he	1256
did	1256
he	1256
took	1256
nothing	1256
by	1256
it	1256
and	1257
has	1257
left	1257
a	1257
legacy	1257
of	1257
sorrow	1257
to	1257
myself	1257
for	1257
he	1257
has	1257
been	1257
gone	1257
a	1257
long	1258
time	1258
and	1258
we	1258
know	1258
not	1258
whether	1258
he	1258
is	1258
alive	1258
or	1258
dead	1258
his	1258
old	1258
father	1258
his	1259
long-suffering	1259
wife	1259
penelope	1259
and	1259
his	1259
son	1259
telemachus	1259
whom	1259
he	1259
left	1260
behind	1260
him	1260
an	1260
infant	1260
in	1260
arms	1260
are	1260
plunged	1260
in	1260
grief	1260
on	1260
his	1260
account	1260
thus	1262
spoke	1262
menelaus	1262
and	1262
the	1262
heart	1262
of	1262
telemachus	1262
yearned	1262
as	1262
he	1262
bethought	1262
him	1263
of	1263
his	1263
father	1263
tears	1263
fell	1263
from	1263
his	1263
eyes	1263
as	1263
he	1263
heard	1263
him	1263
thus	1263
mentioned	1263
so	1264
that	1264
he	1264
held	1264
his	1264
cloak	1264
before	1264
his	1264
face	1264
with	1264
both	1264
hands	1264
when	1264
menelaus	1264
saw	1265
this	1265
he	1265
doubted	1265
whether	1265
to	1265
let	1265
him	1265
choose	1265
his	1265
own	1265
time	1265
for	1265
speaking	1265
or	1266
to	1266
ask	1266
him	1266
at	1266
once	1266
and	1266
find	1266
what	1266
it	1266
was	1266
all	1266
about	1266
while	1268
he	1268
was	1268
thus	1268
in	1268
two	1268
minds	1268
helen	1268
came	1268
down	1268
from	1268
her	1268
high	1268
vaulted	1268
and	1269
perfumed	1269
room	1269
looking	1269
as	1269
lovely	1269
as	1269
diana	1269
herself	1269
adraste	1269
brought	1269
her	1270
a	1270
seat	1270
alcippe	1270
a	1270
soft	1270
woollen	1270

while	1270
phylo	1270

her	1270
the	1270
silver	1271
work-box	1271
which	1271
alcandra	1271

given	1271
her	1271
polybus	1271
lived	1272
in	1272
egyptian	1272
thebes	1272
which	1272
is	1272
the	1272
richest	1272
city	1272
in	1272
the	1272
whole	1272
world	1272
he	1273
gave	1273
menelaus	1273
two	1273
baths	1273
both	1273
of	1273
pure	1273
silver	1273
two	1273
tripods	1273
and	1273
ten	1274
talents	1274
of	1274
gold	1274
besides	1274
all	1274
this	1274
his	1274
wife	1274
gave	1274
helen	1274
some	1274
beautiful	1274
presents	1275
to	1275
wit	1275
a	1275
golden	1275
distaff	1275
and	1275
a	1275
silver	1275
work-box	1275
that	1275
ran	1275
on	1276
wheels	1276
with	1276
a	1276
gold	1276
band	1276
round	1276
the	1276
top	1276
of	1276
it	1276
phylo	1276
now	1276
placed	1276
this	1277
by	1277
her	1277
side	1277
full	1277
of	1277
fine	1277
spun	1277
yarn	1277
and	1277
a	1277
distaff	1277
charged	1277
with	1277
violet	1278
coloured	1278
wool	1278
was	1278
laid	1278
upon	1278
the	1278
top	1278
of	1278
it	1278
then	1278
helen	1278
took	1278
her	1279
seat	1279
put	1279
her	1279
feet	1279
upon	1279
the	1279
footstool	1279
and	1279
began	1279
to	1279
question	1279
her	1279
husband	1280
do	1282
we	1282
know	1282
menelaus	1282
said	1282
she	1282
the	1282
names	1282
of	1282
these	1282
strangers	1282
who	1282
have	1283
come	1283
to	1283
visit	1283
us	1283
shall	1283
i	1283
guess	1283
right	1283
or	1283
wrong?-but	1283
i	1283
cannot	1283
help	1284
saying	1284
what	1284
i	1284
think	1284
never	1284
yet	1284
have	1284
i	1284
seen	1284
either	1284
man	1284
or	1284
woman	1284
so	1285
like	1285
somebody	1285
else	1285
indeed	1285
when	1285
i	1285
look	1285
at	1285
him	1285
i	1285
hardly	1285
know	1285
what	1285
to	1286
think	1286
as	1286
this	1286
young	1286
man	1286
is	1286
like	1286
telemachus	1286
whom	1286
ulysses	1286
left	1286
as	1287
a	1287
baby	1287
behind	1287
him	1287
when	1287
you	1287
achaeans	1287
went	1287
to	1287
troy	1287
with	1287
battle	1287
in	1287
your	1288
hearts	1288
on	1288
account	1288
of	1288
my	1288
most	1288
shameless	1288
self	1288
my	1290
dear	1290
wife	1290
replied	1290
menelaus	1290
i	1290
see	1290
the	1290
likeness	1290
just	1290
as	1290
you	1290
do	1291
his	1291
hands	1291
and	1291
feet	1291
are	1291
just	1291
like	1291
ulysses	1291
so	1291
is	1291
his	1291
hair	1291
with	1291
the	1292
shape	1292
of	1292
his	1292
head	1292
and	1292
the	1292
expression	1292
of	1292
his	1292
eyes	1292
moreover	1292
when	1292
i	1293
was	1293
talking	1293
about	1293
ulysses	1293
and	1293
saying	1293
how	1293
much	1293
he	1293
had	1293
suffered	1293
on	1293
my	1294
account	1294
tears	1294
fell	1294
from	1294
his	1294
eyes	1294
and	1294
he	1294
hid	1294
his	1294
face	1294
in	1294
his	1294
mantle	1294
then	1296
pisistratus	1296
said	1296
menelaus	1296
son	1296
of	1296
atreus	1296
you	1296
are	1296
right	1296
in	1296
thinking	1297
that	1297
this	1297
young	1297
man	1297
is	1297
telemachus	1297
but	1297
he	1297
is	1297
very	1297
modest	1297
and	1298
is	1298
ashamed	1298
to	1298
come	1298
here	1298
and	1298
begin	1298
opening	1298
up	1298
discourse	1298
with	1298
one	1298
whose	1299
conversation	1299
is	1299
so	1299
divinely	1299
interesting	1299
as	1299
your	1299
own	1299
my	1299
father	1299
nestor	1300
sent	1300
me	1300
to	1300
escort	1300
him	1300
hither	1300
for	1300
he	1300
wanted	1300
to	1300
know	1300
whether	1300
you	1301
could	1301
give	1301
him	1301
any	1301
counsel	1301
or	1301
suggestion	1301
a	1301
son	1301
has	1301
always	1301
trouble	1301
at	1302
home	1302
when	1302
his	1302
father	1302
has	1302
gone	1302
away	1302
leaving	1302
him	1302
without	1302
supporters	1302
and	1303
this	1303
is	1303
how	1303
telemachus	1303
is	1303
now	1303
placed	1303
for	1303
his	1303
father	1303
is	1303
absent	1303
and	1304
there	1304
is	1304
no	1304
one	1304
among	1304
his	1304
own	1304
people	1304
to	1304
stand	1304
by	1304
him	1304
bless	1306
my	1306
heart	1306
replied	1306
menelaus	1306
then	1306
i	1306
am	1306
receiving	1306
a	1306
visit	1306
from	1306
the	1307
son	1307
of	1307
a	1307
very	1307
dear	1307
friend	1307
who	1307
suffered	1307
much	1307
hardship	1307
for	1307
my	1307
sake	1307
i	1308
had	1308
always	1308
hoped	1308
to	1308
entertain	1308
him	1308
with	1308
most	1308
marked	1308
distinction	1308
when	1308
heaven	1309
had	1309
granted	1309
us	1309
a	1309
safe	1309
return	1309
from	1309
beyond	1309
the	1309

i	1309
should	1309
have	1310
founded	1310
a	1310
city	1310
for	1310
him	1310
in	1310
argos	1310
and	1310
built	1310
him	1310
a	1310
house	1310
i	1310
should	1310
have	1311
made	1311
him	1311
leave	1311

his	1311
son	1311

all	1311
his	1311

should	1312
have	1312
sacked	1312

them	1312
some	1312
one	1312
of	1312
the	1312
neighbouring	1312
cities	1312
that	1313
are	1313
subject	1313
to	1313
me	1313

should	1313
thus	1313
have	1313
seen	1313
one	1313
another	1313
continually	1313
and	1314
nothing	1314
but	1314
death	1314
could	1314
have	1314
interrupted	1314
so	1314
close	1314
and	1314
happy	1314
an	1314
intercourse	1315
i	1315
suppose	1315
however	1315
that	1315
heaven	1315
grudged	1315
us	1315
such	1315
great	1315
good	1316
fortune	1316
for	1316
it	1316
has	1316
prevented	1316
the	1316
poor	1316
fellow	1316
from	1316
ever	1316
getting	1316
home	1317
at	1317
all	1317
thus	1319
did	1319
he	1319
speak	1319
and	1319
his	1319
words	1319
set	1319
them	1319
all	1319
a	1319
weeping	1319
helen	1319
wept	1319
telemachus	1320
wept	1320
and	1320
so	1320
did	1320
menelaus	1320
nor	1320
could	1320
pisistratus	1320
keep	1320
his	1320
eyes	1321
from	1321
filling	1321
when	1321
he	1321
remembered	1321
his	1321
dear	1321
brother	1321
antilochus	1321
whom	1322
the	1322
son	1322
of	1322
bright	1322

had	1322
killed	1322
thereon	1322

said	1322
to	1322
menelaus	1322
sir	1324
my	1324
father	1324
nestor	1324
when	1324

about	1324
you	1324
at	1324
home	1324
told	1324
me	1325

were	1325
a	1325
person	1325
of	1325
rare	1325
and	1325
excellent	1325

as	1326
i	1326
would	1326
urge	1326
you	1326

our	1329

set	1332
eyes	1332
upon	1332
him	1333
myself	1333
but	1333
they	1333

singularly	1333
fleet	1333
of	1333

what	1364
he	1364
chooses	1364
feast	1364
here	1364
as	1364
you	1364
will	1364
and	1364
listen	1364
while	1365
i	1365
tell	1365
you	1365
a	1365
tale	1365
in	1365
season	1365
i	1365
cannot	1365
indeed	1365
name	1365
every	1365
single	1365
one	1366
of	1366
the	1366
exploits	1366
of	1366
ulysses	1366
but	1366
i	1366
can	1366
say	1366
what	1366
he	1366
did	1366
when	1366
he	1366
was	1367
before	1367
troy	1367
and	1367
you	1367
achaeans	1367
were	1367
in	1367
all	1367
sorts	1367
of	1367
difficulties	1367
he	1368
covered	1368
himself	1368
with	1368
wounds	1368
and	1368
bruises	1368
dressed	1368
himself	1368
all	1368
in	1368
rags	1369
and	1369
entered	1369
the	1369
enemy's	1369
city	1369
looking	1369
like	1369
a	1369
menial	1369
or	1369
a	1369
beggar	1369
and	1370
quite	1370
different	1370
from	1370
what	1370
he	1370
did	1370
when	1370
he	1370
was	1370
among	1370
his	1370
own	1370
people	1370
in	1371
this	1371
disguise	1371
he	1371
entered	1371
the	1371
city	1371
of	1371
troy	1371
and	1371
no	1371
one	1371
said	1371
anything	1371
to	1372
him	1372
i	1372
alone	1372
recognized	1372
him	1372
and	1372
began	1372
to	1372
question	1372
him	1372
but	1372
he	1372
was	1372
too	1373
cunning	1373
for	1373
me	1373
when	1373
however	1373
i	1373
had	1373
washed	1373
and	1373
anointed	1373
him	1373
and	1373
had	1374
given	1374
him	1374
clothes	1374
and	1374
after	1374
i	1374
had	1374
sworn	1374
a	1374
solemn	1374
oath	1374
not	1374
to	1374
betray	1375
him	1375
to	1375
the	1375
trojans	1375
till	1375
he	1375
had	1375
got	1375
safely	1375
back	1375
to	1375
his	1375
own	1375
camp	1375
and	1376
to	1376
the	1376
ships	1376
he	1376
told	1376
me	1376
all	1376
that	1376
the	1376
achaeans	1376
meant	1376
to	1376
do	1376
he	1376
killed	1377
many	1377
trojans	1377
and	1377
got	1377
much	1377
information	1377
before	1377
he	1377
reached	1377
the	1377
argive	1378
camp	1378
for	1378
all	1378
which	1378
things	1378
the	1378
trojan	1378
women	1378
made	1378
lamentation	1378
but	1379
for	1379
my	1379
own	1379
part	1379
i	1379
was	1379
glad	1379
for	1379
my	1379
heart	1379
was	1379
beginning	1379
to	1379
oam	1379
after	1380
my	1380
home	1380
and	1380
i	1380
was	1380
unhappy	1380
about	1380
wrong	1380
that	1380
venus	1380
had	1380
done	1380
me	1380
in	1381
taking	1381
me	1381
over	1381
there	1381
away	1381
from	1381
my	1381
country	1381
my	1381
girl	1381
and	1381
my	1381
lawful	1381
wedded	1382
husband	1382
who	1382
is	1382
indeed	1382
by	1382
no	1382
means	1382
deficient	1382
either	1382
in	1382
person	1382
or	1383
understanding	1383
then	1385
menelaus	1385
said	1385
all	1385
that	1385
you	1385
have	1385
been	1385
saying	1385
my	1385
dear	1385
wife	1385

true	1386
i	1386
have	1386
travelled	1386
much	1386
and	1386
have	1386
had	1386
much	1386
to	1386
do	1386
with	1386
heroes	1386
but	1387
i	1387
have	1387
never	1387
seen	1387
such	1387
another	1387
man	1387
as	1387
ulysses	1387
what	1387
endurance	1387
too	1388
and	1388
what	1388
courage	1388
he	1388
displayed	1388
within	1388
the	1388
wooden	1388
horse	1388
wherein	1388
all	1389
the	1389
bravest	1389
of	1389
the	1389
argives	1389
were	1389
lying	1389
in	1389

to	1389
bring	1389
death	1389
and	1389
destruction	1390
upon	1390
the	1390
trojans	1390
at	1390
that	1390
moment	1390
you	1390
came	1390
up	1390
to	1390
us	1390
some	1390
god	1391
who	1391
wished	1391
well	1391
to	1391
the	1391
trojans	1391
must	1391
have	1391
set	1391
you	1391
on	1391
to	1391
it	1391
and	1391
you	1392
had	1392
deiphobus	1392
with	1392
you	1392
three	1392
times	1392
did	1392
you	1392
go	1392
all	1392
round	1392
our	1392
hiding	1392
place	1393
and	1393
pat	1393
it	1393
you	1393
called	1393
our	1393
chiefs	1393
each	1393
by	1393
his	1393
own	1393
name	1393
and	1393
mimicked	1394
all	1394
our	1394
wives	1394
diomed	1394
ulysses	1394
and	1394
i	1394
from	1394
our	1394
seats	1394
inside	1394
heard	1395
what	1395
a	1395
noise	1395
you	1395
made	1395
diomed	1395
and	1395
i	1395
could	1395
not	1395
make	1395
up	1395
our	1395
minds	1395
whether	1396
to	1396
spring	1396
out	1396
then	1396
and	1396
there	1396
or	1396
to	1396
answer	1396
you	1396
from	1396

anticlus	1398
who	1398
was	1398

anticlus	1400
till	1400
minerva	1400
took	1400
you	1400
away	1400
again	1401
how	1403
sad	1403
exclaimed	1403
telemachus	1403
that	1403
all	1403
this	1403
was	1403
of	1403
no	1403
avail	1403
to	1403
save	1404
him	1404
nor	1404
yet	1404

cloaks	1410
for	1410
the	1410

a	1412

pisistratus	1413
sleep	1413
there	1413
in	1413
the	1413

girded	1418
his	1418

about	1418

then	1419
taking	1419
a	1419
seat	1419
near	1419
telemachus	1419
he	1419

numbers	1428
of	1428
my	1428

loyal	1434
service	1434
either	1434
by	1434
word	1434

very	1438
much	1438
shocked	1438
so	1438
he	1438
exclaimed	1438
these	1439
cowards	1439
would	1439
usurp	1439
a	1439
brave	1439
man's	1439
bed	1439
a	1439
hind	1439

off	1440
to	1440
feed	1440
in	1441
the	1441
forest	1441
or	1441
in	1441
some	1441
grassy	1441
dell	1441
the	1441
lion	1441
when	1441
he	1441
comes	1441
back	1441
to	1442
his	1442
lair	1442
will	1442
make	1442
short	1442
work	1442
with	1442
the	1442
pair	1442
of	1442
them	1442
and	1442
so	1442
will	1442
ulysses	1443
with	1443
these	1443
suitors	1443
by	1443
father	1443
jove	1443
minerva	1443

apollo	1443

still	1444
the	1444
man	1444
that	1444
he	1444
was	1444
when	1444
he	1444
wrestled	1444
with	1444
philomeleides	1444
in	1445
lesbos	1445
and	1445
threw	1445
him	1445
so	1445
heavily	1445
that	1445
all	1445
the	1445
achaeans	1445
cheered	1445
him	1446
if	1446
he	1446
is	1446
still	1446
such	1446
and	1446
were	1446
to	1446
come	1446
near	1446
these	1446
suitors	1446
they	1446
would	1447
have	1447
a	1447
short	1447
shrift	1447
and	1447
a	1447
sorry	1447
wedding	1447
as	1447
regards	1447
your	1447
questions	1447
however	1448
i	1448
will	1448
not	1448
prevaricate	1448
nor	1448
deceive	1448
you	1448

will	1448
tell	1448
you	1448
without	1449
concealment	1449
all	1449
that	1449
the	1449
old	1449
man	1449
of	1449
the	1449
sea	1449
told	1449
me	1449
i	1451
was	1451
trying	1451
to	1451
come	1451
on	1451
here	1451
but	1451
the	1451
gods	1451
detained	1451
me	1451
in	1451
egypt	1451
for	1452
my	1452
hecatombs	1452
had	1452
not	1452
given	1452
them	1452
full	1452
satisfaction	1452
and	1452
the	1452
gods	1452
are	1453
very	1453
strict	1453
about	1453
having	1453
their	1453
dues	1453
now	1453
off	1453
egypt	1453
about	1453
as	1453
far	1453
as	1454
a	1454
ship	1454
can	1454
sail	1454
in	1454
a	1454
day	1454
with	1454
a	1454
good	1454
stiff	1454
breeze	1454
behind	1454
her	1454
there	1454
is	1455
an	1455
island	1455
called	1455
pharos	1455
it	1455
has	1455
a	1455
good	1455
harbour	1455
from	1455
which	1455
vessels	1455
can	1456
get	1456
out	1456
into	1456
open	1456
sea	1456
when	1456
they	1456
have	1456
taken	1456
in	1456
water	1456
and	1456
the	1456
gods	1456
becalmed	1457
me	1457
twenty	1457
days	1457
without	1457
so	1457
much	1457
as	1457
a	1457
breath	1457
of	1457
fair	1457
wind	1457
to	1457
help	1458
me	1458
forward	1458
we	1458
should	1458
have	1458
run	1458
clean	1458
out	1458
of	1458
provisions	1458
and	1458
my	1458
men	1459
would	1459
have	1459
starved	1459
if	1459
a	1459
goddess	1459
had	1459
not	1459
taken	1459
pity	1459
upon	1459
me	1459
and	1459
saved	1460
me	1460
in	1460
the	1460
person	1460
of	1460
idothea	1460
daughter	1460
to	1460
proteus	1460
the	1460
old	1460

taken	1461
a	1461
great	1461
fancy	1461
to	1461
me	1461
she	1463
came	1463
to	1463
me	1463
one	1463
day	1463
when	1463
i	1463
was	1463
by	1463
myself	1463
as	1463
i	1463
often	1463
was	1463
for	1463
the	1464
men	1464
used	1464
to	1464
go	1464
with	1464
their	1464
barbed	1464
hooks	1464
all	1464
over	1464
the	1464
island	1464
in	1464
the	1465
hope	1465
of	1465
catching	1465
a	1465
fish	1465
or	1465
two	1465
to	1465
save	1465
them	1465
from	1465
the	1465
pangs	1465
of	1465
hunger	1466
stranger	1466

me	1466
that	1466
you	1466

in	1467
this	1467
way	1467

here	1468
day	1468
after	1468
day	1468
without	1468
even	1468
trying	1468
to	1468
get	1468
away	1468

your	1468
men	1469

dying	1469
by	1469
inches	1469
let	1471
me	1471

staying	1472
here	1472
of	1472
my	1472

up	1495
from	1495
under	1495
the	1495

heralded	1495
by	1495
the	1495

in	1497
a	1497
great	1497

and	1499
fish-like	1499

therefore	1501
the	1502
three	1502
best	1502
men	1502
you	1502
have	1502
in	1502
your	1502
fleet	1502
and	1502
i	1502
will	1502
tell	1502
you	1502
all	1502
the	1503
tricks	1503
that	1503
the	1503
old	1503
man	1503
will	1503
play	1503
you	1503
first	1505
he	1505
will	1505
look	1505
over	1505
all	1505
his	1505
seals	1505
and	1505
count	1505
them	1505
then	1505
when	1505
he	1506
has	1506
seen	1506
them	1506
and	1506
tallied	1506
them	1506
on	1506
his	1506
five	1506
fingers	1506
he	1506
will	1506
go	1506
to	1507
sleep	1507
among	1507
them	1507
as	1507
a	1507
shepherd	1507
among	1507
his	1507
sheep	1507
the	1507
moment	1507
you	1507
see	1508
that	1508
he	1508
is	1508
asleep	1508
seize	1508
him	1508
put	1508
forth	1508
all	1508
your	1508
strength	1508
and	1508
hold	1508
him	1509
fast	1509
for	1509
he	1509
will	1509
do	1509
his	1509
very	1509
utmost	1509
to	1509
get	1509
away	1509
from	1509
you	1509
he	1509
will	1510
turn	1510
himself	1510
into	1510
every	1510
kind	1510
of	1510
creature	1510
that	1510
goes	1510
upon	1510
the	1510
earth	1510
and	1511
will	1511
become	1511
also	1511
both	1511
fire	1511
and	1511
water	1511
but	1511
you	1511
must	1511
hold	1511
him	1511
fast	1511
and	1512
grip	1512
him	1512
tighter	1512
and	1512
tighter	1512
till	1512
he	1512
begins	1512
to	1512
talk	1512
to	1512
you	1512
and	1512
comes	1513
back	1513
to	1513
what	1513
he	1513
was	1513
when	1513
you	1513
saw	1513
him	1513
go	1513
to	1513
sleep	1513
then	1513
you	1513
may	1513
slacken	1514
your	1514
hold	1514
and	1514
let	1514
him	1514
go	1514
and	1514
you	1514
can	1514
ask	1514
him	1514
which	1514
of	1514
the	1514
gods	1515
it	1515
is	1515
that	1515
is	1515
angry	1515
with	1515
you	1515
and	1515
what	1515
you	1515
must	1515
do	1515
to	1515
reach	1515
your	1515
home	1516
over	1516
the	1516
seas	1516
having	1518
so	1518
said	1518
she	1518
dived	1518
under	1518
the	1518
waves	1518
whereon	1518
i	1518
turned	1518
back	1518
to	1518
the	1519
place	1519
where	1519
my	1519
ships	1519
were	1519
ranged	1519
upon	1519
the	1519
shore	1519
and	1519
my	1519
heart	1519
was	1520
clouded	1520
with	1520
care	1520
as	1520
i	1520
went	1520
along	1520
when	1520
i	1520
reached	1520
my	1520
ship	1520
we	1520
got	1520
supper	1521
ready	1521
for	1521
night	1521
was	1521
falling	1521
and	1521
camped	1521
down	1521
upon	1521
the	1521
beach	1521
when	1523
the	1523
child	1523
of	1523
morning	1523
rosy-fingered	1523
dawn	1523
appeared	1523
i	1523
took	1523
the	1523
three	1524
men	1524
on	1524
whose	1524
prowess	1524
of	1524
all	1524
kinds	1524
i	1524
could	1524
most	1524
rely	1524
and	1524
went	1524
along	1525
by	1525
the	1525
sea-side	1525
praying	1525
heartily	1525
to	1525
heaven	1525
meanwhile	1525
the	1525
goddess	1525
fetched	1526
me	1526
up	1526
four	1526
seal	1526
skins	1526
from	1526
the	1526
bottom	1526
of	1526
the	1526
sea	1526
all	1526
of	1526
them	1526
just	1527
skinned	1527
for	1527
she	1527
meant	1527
playing	1527
a	1527
trick	1527
upon	1527
her	1527
father	1527
then	1527
she	1528
dug	1528
four	1528
pits	1528
for	1528
us	1528
to	1528
lie	1528
in	1528
and	1528
sat	1528
down	1528
to	1528
wait	1528
till	1528
we	1528
should	1528
come	1529
up	1529
when	1529
we	1529
were	1529
close	1529
to	1529
her	1529
she	1529
made	1529
us	1529
lie	1529
down	1529
in	1529
the	1529
pits	1529
one	1530
after	1530
the	1530
other	1530
and	1530
threw	1530
a	1530
seal	1530
skin	1530
over	1530
each	1530
of	1530
us	1530
our	1530
ambuscade	1530
would	1531
have	1531
been	1531
intolerable	1531
for	1531
the	1531
stench	1531
of	1531
the	1531
fishy	1531
seals	1531
was	1531
most	1532
distressing	1532
who	1532
would	1532
go	1532
to	1532
bed	1532
with	1532
a	1532
sea	1532
monster	1532
if	1532
he	1532
could	1532
help	1533
it?-but	1533
here	1533
too	1533
the	1533
goddess	1533
helped	1533
us	1533
and	1533
thought	1533
of	1533
something	1533
that	1534
gave	1534
us	1534
great	1534
relief	1534
for	1534
she	1534
put	1534
some	1534
ambrosia	1534
under	1534
each	1534
man's	1534
nostrils	1535
which	1535
was	1535
so	1535
fragrant	1535
that	1535
it	1535
killed	1535
the	1535
smell	1535
of	1535
the	1535
seals	1535
we	1537
waited	1537
the	1537
whole	1537
morning	1537
and	1537
made	1537
the	1537
best	1537
of	1537
it	1537
watching	1537
the	1537
seals	1538
come	1538
up	1538
in	1538
hundreds	1538
to	1538
bask	1538
upon	1538
the	1538
sea	1538
shore	1538
till	1538
at	1538
noon	1538
the	1539
old	1539
man	1539
of	1539
the	1539
sea	1539
came	1539
up	1539
too	1539
and	1539
when	1539
he	1539
had	1539
found	1539
his	1539
fat	1539
seals	1540
he	1540
went	1540
over	1540
them	1540
and	1540
counted	1540
them	1540
we	1540
were	1540
among	1540
the	1540
first	1540
he	1541
counted	1541
and	1541
he	1541
never	1541
suspected	1541
any	1541
guile	1541
but	1541
laid	1541
himself	1541
down	1541
to	1542
sleep	1542
as	1542
soon	1542
as	1542
he	1542
had	1542
done	1542
counting	1542
then	1542
we	1542
rushed	1542
upon	1542
him	1542
with	1543
a	1543
shout	1543
and	1543
seized	1543
him	1543
on	1543
which	1543
he	1543
began	1543
at	1543
once	1543
with	1543
his	1543
old	1543
tricks	1544
and	1544
changed	1544
himself	1544
first	1544
into	1544
a	1544
lion	1544
with	1544
a	1544
great	1544
mane	1544
then	1544
all	1545
of	1545
a	1545
sudden	1545
he	1545
became	1545
a	1545
dragon	1545
a	1545
leopard	1545
a	1545
wild	1545
boar	1545
the	1545
next	1545
moment	1546
he	1546
was	1546
running	1546
water	1546
and	1546
then	1546
again	1546
directly	1546
he	1546
was	1546
a	1546
tree	1546
but	1547
we	1547
stuck	1547
to	1547
him	1547
and	1547
never	1547
lost	1547
hold	1547
till	1547
at	1547
last	1547
the	1547
cunning	1547
old	1548
creature	1548
became	1548
distressed	1548
and	1548
said	1548
which	1548
of	1548
the	1548
gods	1548
was	1548
it	1548
son	1549
of	1549
atreus	1549
that	1549
hatched	1549
this	1549
plot	1549
with	1549
you	1549
for	1549
snaring	1549
me	1549
and	1549
seizing	1550
me	1550
against	1550
my	1550
will	1550
what	1550
do	1550
you	1550
want	1550
you	1552
know	1552
that	1552
yourself	1552
old	1552
man	1552
i	1552
answered	1552
you	1552
will	1552
gain	1552
nothing	1552
by	1553
trying	1553
to	1553
put	1553
me	1553
off	1553
it	1553
is	1553
because	1553
i	1553
have	1553
been	1553
kept	1553
so	1553
long	1553
in	1553
this	1554
island	1554
and	1554
see	1554
no	1554
sign	1554
of	1554
my	1554
being	1554
able	1554
to	1554
get	1554
away	1554
i	1554
am	1554
losing	1554
all	1555
heart	1555
tell	1555
me	1555
then	1555
for	1555
you	1555
gods	1555
know	1555
everything	1555
which	1555
of	1555
the	1555
immortals	1556
it	1556
is	1556
that	1556
is	1556
hindering	1556
me	1556
and	1556
tell	1556
me	1556
also	1556
how	1556
i	1556
may	1556
sail	1556
the	1557
sea	1557
so	1557
as	1557
to	1557
reach	1557
my	1557
home	1557
then	1559
he	1559
said	1559
if	1559
you	1559
would	1559
finish	1559
your	1559
voyage	1559
and	1559
get	1559
home	1559
quickly	1559
you	1560
must	1560
offer	1560
sacrifices	1560
to	1560
jove	1560
and	1560
to	1560
the	1560
rest	1560
of	1560
the	1560
gods	1560
before	1560
embarking	1561
for	1561

is	1561
decreed	1561
that	1561
you	1561
shall	1561
not	1561
get	1561
back	1561
to	1561
your	1561
friends	1561
and	1562
to	1562
your	1562
own	1562
house	1562
till	1562
you	1562
have	1562
returned	1562
to	1562
the	1562
heaven	1562
fed	1562
stream	1562
of	1563
egypt	1563
and	1563
offered	1563
holy	1563
hecatombs	1563
to	1563
the	1563
immortal	1563
gods	1563
that	1563

in	1564
heaven	1564
when	1564
you	1564
have	1564
done	1564

they	1564
will	1564
let	1564
you	1564
finish	1564
your	1564
voyage	1564
i	1566
was	1566
broken	1566
hearted	1566
when	1566
i	1566
heard	1566
that	1566
i	1566
must	1566
go	1566
back	1566
all	1566
that	1566
long	1566
and	1567
terrible	1567
voyage	1567
to	1567
egypt	1567
nevertheless	1567
i	1567
answered	1567

do	1567
all	1568
old	1568
man	1568
that	1568
you	1568

upon	1568
me	1568
but	1568
now	1568
tell	1568
me	1568
and	1568
tell	1568
me	1569
true	1569
whether	1569
all	1569
the	1569
achaeans	1569
whom	1569
nestor	1569
and	1569
i	1569
left	1569
behind	1569
us	1569
when	1570
we	1570
set	1570
sail	1570
from	1570
troy	1570
have	1570
got	1570
home	1570
safely	1570
or	1570
whether	1570
any	1570
one	1570
of	1571
them	1571
came	1571
to	1571
a	1571
bad	1571
end	1571
either	1571
on	1571
board	1571
his	1571
own	1571
ship	1571
or	1571
among	1571
his	1571
friends	1572
when	1572
the	1572
days	1572
of	1572
his	1572
fighting	1572
were	1572
done	1572
son	1574
of	1574
atreus	1574
he	1574
answered	1574
why	1574
ask	1574
me	1574
you	1574
had	1574
better	1574
not	1574
know	1574
what	1575
i	1575
can	1575
tell	1575
you	1575
for	1575
your	1575
eyes	1575
will	1575
surely	1575
fill	1575
when	1575
you	1575
have	1575
heard	1576
my	1576
story	1576
many	1576
of	1576
those	1576
about	1576
whom	1576
you	1576
ask	1576
are	1576
dead	1576
and	1576
gone	1576
but	1577
many	1577
still	1577
remain	1577
and	1577
only	1577
two	1577
of	1577
the	1577
chief	1577
men	1577
among	1577
the	1577
achaeans	1577
perished	1578
during	1578
their	1578
return	1578
home	1578
as	1578
for	1578
what	1578
happened	1578
on	1578
the	1578
field	1578
of	1579
battle	1579
you	1579
were	1579
there	1579
yourself	1579
a	1579
third	1579
achaean	1579
leader	1579
is	1579
still	1579
at	1580
sea	1580
alive	1580
but	1580
hindered	1580
from	1580
returning	1580
ajax	1580
was	1580
wrecked	1580
for	1580
neptune	1581
drove	1581
him	1581
on	1581
to	1581
the	1581
great	1581
rocks	1581
of	1581
gyrae	1581
nevertheless	1581
he	1581
let	1582
him	1582
get	1582
safe	1582
out	1582
of	1582
the	1582
water	1582
and	1582
in	1582
spite	1582
of	1582
all	1582
minerva's	1582
hatred	1582
he	1583
would	1583
have	1583
escaped	1583
death	1583
if	1583
he	1583
had	1583
not	1583
ruined	1583
himself	1583
by	1583
boasting	1583
he	1584
said	1584
the	1584
gods	1584
could	1584
not	1584
drown	1584
him	1584
even	1584
though	1584
they	1584
had	1584
tried	1584
to	1584
do	1585
so	1585
and	1585
when	1585
neptune	1585
heard	1585
this	1585
large	1585
talk	1585
he	1585
seized	1585
his	1585
trident	1585
in	1586
his	1586
two	1586
brawny	1586
hands	1586
and	1586
split	1586
the	1586
rock	1586
of	1586
gyrae	1586
in	1586
two	1586
pieces	1586
the	1587
base	1587
remained	1587
where	1587
it	1587
was	1587
but	1587
the	1587
part	1587
on	1587
which	1587
ajax	1587
was	1587
sitting	1587
fell	1588
headlong	1588
into	1588
the	1588
sea	1588
and	1588
carried	1588
ajax	1588
with	1588
it	1588
so	1588
he	1588
drank	1588
salt	1588
water	1589
and	1589
was	1589
drowned	1589
your	1591
brother	1591
and	1591
his	1591
ships	1591
escaped	1591
for	1591
juno	1591
protected	1591
him	1591
but	1591
when	1592
he	1592
was	1592
just	1592
about	1592
to	1592
reach	1592
the	1592
high	1592
promontory	1592
of	1592
malea	1592
he	1592
was	1592
caught	1593
by	1593
a	1593
heavy	1593
gale	1593
which	1593
carried	1593
him	1593
out	1593
to	1593
sea	1593
again	1593
sorely	1593
against	1593
his	1594
will	1594
and	1594
drove	1594
him	1594
to	1594
the	1594
foreland	1594
where	1594
thyestes	1594
used	1594
to	1594
dwell	1594
but	1595
where	1595
aegisthus	1595
was	1595
then	1595
living	1595
by	1595
and	1595
by	1595
however	1595
it	1595
seemed	1595
as	1596
though	1596
he	1596
was	1596
to	1596
return	1596
safely	1596
after	1596
all	1596
for	1596
the	1596
gods	1596
backed	1596
the	1596
wind	1597
into	1597
its	1597
old	1597
quarter	1597
and	1597
they	1597
reached	1597
home	1597
whereon	1597
agamemnon	1597
kissed	1598
his	1598
native	1598
soil	1598
and	1598
shed	1598
tears	1598
of	1598
joy	1598
at	1598
finding	1598
himself	1598
in	1598
his	1599
own	1599
country	1599
now	1601
there	1601
was	1601
a	1601
watchman	1601
whom	1601
aegisthus	1601
kept	1601
always	1601
on	1601
the	1601
watch	1601
and	1602
to	1602
whom	1602
he	1602
had	1602
promised	1602
two	1602
talents	1602
of	1602
gold	1602
this	1602
man	1602
had	1602
been	1602
looking	1603
out	1603
for	1603
a	1603
whole	1603
year	1603
to	1603
make	1603
sure	1603
that	1603
agamemnon	1603
did	1603
not	1603
give	1603
him	1604
the	1604
slip	1604
and	1604
prepare	1604
war	1604
when	1604
therefore	1604
this	1604
man	1604
saw	1604
agamemnon	1604
go	1605
by	1605
he	1605
went	1605
and	1605
told	1605
aegisthus	1605
who	1605
at	1605
once	1605
began	1605
to	1605
lay	1605
a	1605
plot	1605
for	1606
him	1606
he	1606
picked	1606
twenty	1606
of	1606
his	1606
bravest	1606
warriors	1606
and	1606
placed	1606
them	1606
in	1607
ambuscade	1607
on	1607
one	1607
side	1607
the	1607
cloister	1607
while	1607
on	1607
the	1607
opposite	1607
side	1607
he	1608
prepared	1608
a	1608
banquet	1608
then	1608
he	1608
sent	1608
his	1608
chariots	1608
and	1608
horsemen	1608
to	1608
agamemnon	1608
and	1609
invited	1609
him	1609
to	1609
the	1609
feast	1609
but	1609
he	1609
meant	1609
foul	1609
play	1609
he	1609
got	1609
him	1609
there	1609
all	1610
unsuspicious	1610
of	1610
the	1610
doom	1610
that	1610
was	1610
awaiting	1610
him	1610
and	1610
killed	1610
him	1610
when	1611
the	1611
banquet	1611
was	1611
over	1611
as	1611
though	1611
he	1611
were	1611
butchering	1611
an	1611
ox	1611
in	1611
the	1611
shambles	1612
not	1612
one	1612
of	1612
agamemnon's	1612
followers	1612
was	1612
left	1612
alive	1612
nor	1612
yet	1612
one	1613
of	1613
aegisthus	1613
but	1613
they	1613
were	1613
all	1613
killed	1613
there	1613
in	1613
the	1613
cloisters	1613
thus	1615
spoke	1615
proteus	1615
and	1615
i	1615
was	1615
broken	1615
hearted	1615
as	1615
i	1615
heard	1615
him	1615
i	1615
sat	1615
down	1616
upon	1616
the	1616
sands	1616
and	1616
wept	1616
i	1616
felt	1616
as	1616
though	1616
i	1616
could	1616
no	1616
longer	1616
bear	1616
to	1617
live	1617
nor	1617
look	1617
upon	1617
the	1617
light	1617
of	1617
the	1617
sun	1617
presently	1617
when	1617
i	1617
had	1617
had	1618
my	1618
fill	1618
of	1618
weeping	1618
and	1618
writhing	1618
upon	1618
the	1618
ground	1618
the	1618
old	1618
man	1618
of	1618
the	1619
sea	1619

of	1619
atreus	1619

not	1619
waste	1619
any	1619
more	1619
time	1619
in	1619
crying	1619
so	1620
bitterly	1620

your	1620
way	1620

as	1621
ever	1621
you	1621
can	1621
for	1621
aegisthus	1621
be	1621
still	1621
alive	1621
and	1621
even	1621
though	1621
orestes	1621

beforehand	1622
with	1622
you	1622
in	1622
kilting	1622
him	1622
you	1622
may	1622
yet	1622
come	1622
in	1622
for	1622
his	1622
funeral	1623
on	1625
this	1625
i	1625
took	1625
comfort	1625
in	1625
spite	1625
of	1625
all	1625
my	1625
sorrow	1625
and	1625

third	1626

you	1627
spoke	1627

he	1627
still	1627
alive	1627

at	1627

me	1628
the	1630
third	1630
man	1630
he	1630
answered	1630
is	1630
ulysses	1630
who	1630
dwells	1630
in	1630
ithaca	1630
i	1630
can	1631
see	1631
him	1631
in	1631
an	1631
island	1631
sorrowing	1631
bitterly	1631
in	1631
the	1631
house	1631
of	1631
the	1631
nymph	1631
calypso	1632
who	1632
is	1632
keeping	1632
him	1632

and	1632
he	1632
cannot	1632
reach	1632

has	1633
no	1633

sailors	1633
to	1633
take	1633
him	1633
over	1633
the	1633

as	1633
for	1633
your	1633

menelaus	1634
you	1634

not	1634

you	1635
to	1635
the	1635
elysian	1635

is	1635
at	1635
the	1635
ends	1635
of	1635
the	1635
world	1635
there	1635
fair-haired	1636
rhadamanthus	1636
reigns	1636
and	1636
men	1636
lead	1636
an	1636
easier	1636

with	1638
a	1638
west	1638

that	1638
sings	1639
softly	1639
from	1639
the	1639

gives	1639
fresh	1639
life	1639

all	1639
men	1639
this	1639
will	1639
happen	1640
to	1640
you	1640

you	1640
have	1640
married	1640
helen	1640
and	1640
are	1640
jove's	1640
son-in-law	1640
as	1642
he	1642
spoke	1642
he	1642
dived	1642
under	1642
the	1642
waves	1642
whereon	1642
i	1642
turned	1642
back	1642
to	1642
the	1642
ships	1643
with	1643
my	1643
companions	1643
and	1643
my	1643
heart	1643
was	1643
clouded	1643
with	1643
care	1643
as	1643
i	1643
went	1644
along	1644
when	1644
we	1644
reached	1644
the	1644
ships	1644
we	1644
got	1644
supper	1644
ready	1644
for	1644
night	1644
was	1645
falling	1645
and	1645
camped	1645
down	1645
upon	1645
the	1645
beach	1645
when	1645
the	1645
child	1645
of	1645
morning	1645
rosy-fingered	1646
dawn	1646
appeared	1646
we	1646
drew	1646
our	1646
ships	1646
into	1646
the	1646
water	1646
and	1646
put	1647
our	1647
masts	1647
and	1647
sails	1647
within	1647
them	1647
then	1647
we	1647
went	1647
on	1647
board	1647
ourselves	1647
took	1648
our	1648
seats	1648
on	1648
the	1648
benches	1648
and	1648
smote	1648
the	1648
grey	1648
sea	1648
with	1648
our	1648
oars	1648
i	1649
again	1649
stationed	1649
my	1649
ships	1649
in	1649
the	1649
heaven-fed	1649
stream	1649
of	1649
egypt	1649
and	1649
offered	1650
hecatombs	1650
that	1650
were	1650
full	1650
and	1650
sufficient	1650
when	1650
i	1650
had	1650
thus	1650
appeased	1650
heaven's	1651
anger	1651
i	1651
raised	1651
a	1651
barrow	1651
to	1651
the	1651
memory	1651
of	1651
agamemnon	1651
that	1651
his	1652
name	1652
might	1652
live	1652
for	1652
ever	1652
after	1652
which	1652
i	1652
had	1652
a	1652
quick	1652
passage	1652
home	1652
for	1653
the	1653
gods	1653
sent	1653
me	1653
a	1653
fair	1653

here	1655
some	1655
ten	1655

twelve	1655
days	1655
longer	1655

i	1656
will	1656
then	1656
speed	1656
you	1656
on	1656
your	1656
way	1656
i	1656
will	1656
make	1656
you	1656
a	1656
noble	1656
present	1656
of	1657
a	1657
chariot	1657
and	1657
three	1657
horses	1657
i	1657
will	1657
also	1657
give	1657
you	1657
a	1657
beautiful	1657
chalice	1657
that	1658
so	1658
long	1658
as	1658
you	1658
live	1658
you	1658
may	1658
think	1658
of	1658
me	1658
whenever	1658
you	1658

a	1658
drink-offering	1658

me	1661
to	1661

your	1663
conversation	1663
so	1663
delightful	1663
that	1663
i	1663
should	1663
never	1663
once	1663
wish	1663
myself	1664
at	1664
home	1664
with	1664
my	1664
parents	1664
but	1664
my	1664
crew	1664
whom	1664
i	1664
have	1664
left	1664
at	1664
pylos	1664
are	1665
already	1665
impatient	1665
and	1665
you	1665
are	1665
detaining	1665
me	1665
from	1665
them	1665
as	1665
for	1665
any	1666
present	1666
you	1666
may	1666
be	1666
disposed	1666
to	1666
make	1666
me	1666
i	1666
had	1666
rather	1666
that	1666
it	1666
should	1666
he	1667
a	1667
piece	1667
of	1667
plate	1667
i	1667
will	1667
take	1667
no	1667
horses	1667
back	1667
with	1667
me	1667
to	1667
ithaca	1667
but	1668
will	1668
leave	1668
them	1668
to	1668
adorn	1668
your	1668
own	1668
stables	1668
for	1668
you	1668
have	1668
much	1668
flat	1668
ground	1669
in	1669
your	1669
kingdom	1669
where	1669
lotus	1669
thrives	1669
as	1669
also	1669
meadowsweet	1669
and	1669
wheat	1670

oats	1670
with	1670
their	1670
white	1670

we	1671
have	1671
neither	1671
open	1671
fields	1671
nor	1671
racecourses	1671
and	1671
the	1671
country	1671
is	1672
more	1672
fit	1672
for	1672
goats	1672
than	1672
horses	1672
and	1672
i	1672
like	1672
it	1672
the	1672
better	1672
for	1672
that	1672
none	1673
of	1673
our	1673
islands	1673
have	1673
much	1673
level	1673
ground	1673
suitable	1673
for	1673
horses	1673
and	1673
ithaca	1674
least	1674
of	1674
all	1674
menelaus	1676
smiled	1676
and	1676
took	1676
telemachus's	1676
hand	1676
within	1676
his	1676
own	1676
what	1676
you	1676
say	1677
said	1677
he	1677
shows	1677
that	1677
you	1677
come	1677
of	1677
good	1677
family	1677
i	1677
both	1677

and	1677
will	1678
make	1678
this	1678
exchange	1678
for	1678

by	1678
giving	1678
you	1678
the	1678
finest	1678

the	1681
sidonians	1681
gave	1681
it	1681
me	1681
in	1681
the	1681
course	1681
of	1681
a	1681
visit	1681
which	1682
i	1682

him	1682
when	1682

make	1683
you	1683

they	1685
converse	1685
and	1685
guests	1685
kept	1685
coming	1685
to	1685
the	1685
king's	1685
house	1685
they	1686
brought	1686
sheep	1686

bread	1686
for	1686
them	1687
to	1687

busy	1687
cooking	1687
their	1687
dinners	1687
in	1687
the	1688
courts	1688
meanwhile	1690
the	1690
suitors	1690

throwing	1690
discs	1690
or	1690
aiming	1690
with	1690
spears	1690
at	1690
a	1691
mark	1691
on	1691
the	1691

much	1693
the	1693
foremost	1693
among	1693
them	1693
all	1693
were	1693
sitting	1694
together	1694
when	1694
noemon	1694
son	1694
of	1694
phronius	1694
came	1694
up	1694
and	1694
said	1694
to	1694
antinous	1694
have	1696
we	1696
any	1696
idea	1696
antinous	1696
on	1696
what	1696
day	1696
telemachus	1696
returns	1696
from	1696
pylos	1696
he	1697
has	1697
a	1697

they	1702
were	1702
astounded	1702
when	1702
they	1702
heard	1702
this	1702
for	1702
they	1702
had	1702
made	1702
sure	1702
that	1702

not	1703
gone	1703
to	1703
the	1703
city	1703
of	1703
neleus	1703
they	1703
thought	1703

only	1704
away	1704
somewhere	1704
on	1704
the	1704
farms	1704

the	1704
sheep	1704
or	1704
with	1704
the	1705
swineherd	1705
so	1705
antinous	1705
said	1705
when	1705

he	1705
go	1705
tell	1705
me	1705
truly	1705
and	1705
what	1706
young	1706

take	1706
with	1706
him	1706
were	1706
they	1706
freemen	1706
or	1706
his	1706

the	1708
ship	1708
of	1708
your	1708
own	1708
free	1708
will	1708
because	1708
he	1708
asked	1708
you	1708
or	1708

answered	1711
noemon	1711
what	1711
else	1711
could	1711
i	1711
do	1711
when	1711
a	1711
man	1711
of	1712
his	1712
position	1712
said	1712
he	1712
was	1712
in	1712
a	1712
difficulty	1712
and	1712
asked	1712
me	1712
to	1712
oblige	1712
him	1713
i	1713
could	1713
not	1713
possibly	1713
refuse	1713
as	1713
for	1713
those	1713
who	1713
went	1713
with	1713
him	1713
they	1713
were	1714
the	1714
best	1714
young	1714
men	1714
we	1714
have	1714
and	1714
i	1714
saw	1714

on	1714
board	1714
as	1714
captain	1714
or	1715
some	1715
god	1715
who	1715
was	1715
exactly	1715
like	1715
him	1715
i	1715
cannot	1715
understand	1715
it	1715
for	1715
i	1716
saw	1716
mentor	1716
here	1716
myself	1716
yesterday	1716
morning	1716
and	1716

then	1719
went	1719
back	1719
to	1719
his	1719
father's	1719
house	1719
but	1719
antinous	1719
and	1719
eurymachus	1719
were	1720
very	1720
angry	1720
they	1720
told	1720
the	1720
others	1720
to	1720
leave	1720
off	1720
playing	1720
and	1720
to	1720
come	1721

they	1721
came	1721
antinous	1721
son	1722
of	1722
eupeithes	1722
spoke	1722
in	1722
anger	1722
his	1722
heart	1722
was	1722
black	1722
with	1722
rage	1722
and	1722
his	1723
eyes	1723
flashed	1723
fire	1723
as	1723
he	1723
said	1723
good	1725
heavens	1725
this	1725
voyage	1725
of	1725
telemachus	1725
is	1725
a	1725
very	1725
serious	1725
matter	1725
we	1726
had	1726
made	1726
sure	1726
that	1726
it	1726
would	1726
come	1726
to	1726
nothing	1726
but	1726
the	1726
young	1726
fellow	1726
has	1727
got	1727
away	1727
in	1727
spite	1727
of	1727
us	1727
and	1727
with	1727
a	1727
picked	1727
crew	1727
too	1727
he	1727
will	1727
be	1727
giving	1728
us	1728
trouble	1728
presently	1728
may	1728

crew	1729
of	1729
twenty	1729
men	1729

i	1729
will	1729
lie	1729
in	1730

for	1730
him	1730
in	1730
the	1730
straits	1730
between	1730
ithaca	1730
and	1730
samos	1730
he	1730
will	1730
then	1730
rue	1731
the	1731
day	1731
that	1731
he	1731
set	1731
out	1731
to	1731
try	1731
and	1731
get	1731
news	1731
of	1731

he	1733
speak	1733
and	1733
the	1733
others	1733
applauded	1733
his	1733
saying	1733
they	1733
then	1733

of	1734
them	1734
went	1734
inside	1734
the	1734
buildings	1734
it	1736
was	1736
not	1736
long	1736
ere	1736
penelope	1736
came	1736
to	1736
know	1736
what	1736
the	1736
suitors	1736
were	1736
plotting	1736
for	1737
a	1737
man	1737
servant	1737
medon	1737
overheard	1737
them	1737
from	1737
outside	1737
the	1737
outer	1737
court	1737
as	1738
they	1738
were	1738
laying	1738
their	1738
schemes	1738
within	1738
and	1738
went	1738
to	1738
tell	1738
his	1738
mistress	1738

crossed	1739
the	1739

dine	1742
henceforward	1742
neither	1742
here	1742
nor	1742
anywhere	1742

but	1743
let	1743
this	1743
be	1743
the	1743
very	1743
last	1743
time	1743
for	1743
the	1743
waste	1743

all	1743
make	1743
of	1743
my	1744

you	1744
when	1744
you	1744
were	1744
children	1744
how	1745
good	1745
ulysses	1745

been	1745
to	1745
them	1745
never	1745
doing	1745
anything	1745
high-handed	1745
nor	1746
speaking	1746
harshly	1746
to	1746
anybody	1746
kings	1746
may	1746
say	1746
things	1746
sometimes	1746
and	1746
they	1747
may	1747
take	1747
a	1747
fancy	1747
to	1747
one	1747
man	1747
and	1747
dislike	1747
another	1747
but	1747
ulysses	1747
never	1748
did	1748
an	1748
unjust	1748
thing	1748
by	1748
anybody	1748
which	1748
shows	1748
what	1748
bad	1748
hearts	1748
you	1749
have	1749
and	1749
that	1749
there	1749

no	1749
such	1749
thing	1749
as	1749
gratitude	1749
left	1749

madam	1752
that	1752
this	1752
were	1752
all	1752

they	1752
are	1752
plotting	1753
something	1753
much	1753
more	1753
dreadful	1753
now	1753
may	1753
heaven	1753
frustrate	1753
their	1753
design	1754
they	1754
are	1754
going	1754
to	1754
try	1754
and	1754

penelope's	1758
heart	1758
sank	1758
within	1758
her	1758
and	1758
for	1758
a	1758
long	1758
time	1758
she	1758
was	1758
speechless	1759
her	1759
eyes	1759
filled	1759
with	1759
tears	1759

on	1766
his	1766

clamorous	1819
throughout	1819
the	1819

now	1823
been	1823
doomed	1823
to	1823
die	1823
this	1825
was	1825
what	1825
they	1825
said	1825
but	1825
they	1825
did	1825
not	1825
know	1825
what	1825
was	1825
going	1825
to	1825
happen	1825
then	1826
antinous	1826

let	1826

be	1826
no	1826
loud	1826

about	1828
which	1828
we	1828
are	1828
all	1828
of	1828
a	1828
mind	1828
he	1830
then	1830
chose	1830
twenty	1830
men	1830
and	1830
they	1830
went	1830
down	1830
to	1830
their	1830
ship	1830
and	1830
to	1830
the	1831
sea	1831
side	1831
they	1831
drew	1831
the	1831
vessel	1831
into	1831
the	1831
water	1831
and	1831
got	1831
her	1831
mast	1831
and	1832
sails	1832
inside	1832
her	1832
they	1832
bound	1832
the	1832
oars	1832
to	1832
the	1832
thole-pins	1832
with	1832
twisted	1832
thongs	1833
of	1833
leather	1833
all	1833
in	1833
due	1833
course	1833
and	1833
spread	1833
the	1833
white	1833
sails	1833
aloft	1833
while	1834
their	1834
fine	1834
servants	1834
brought	1834
them	1834
their	1834
armour	1834
then	1834
they	1834
made	1834
the	1835
ship	1835
fast	1835
a	1835
little	1835
way	1835
out	1835
came	1835
on	1835
shore	1835
again	1835
got	1835
their	1835
suppers	1835
and	1836
waited	1836
till	1836
night	1836
should	1836
fall	1836
but	1838
penelope	1838
lay	1838
in	1838
her	1838
own	1838
room	1838
upstairs	1838
unable	1838
to	1838
eat	1838
or	1838
drink	1838
and	1839
wondering	1839
whether	1839
her	1839
brave	1839
son	1839
would	1839
escape	1839
or	1839
be	1839
overpowered	1839
by	1840
the	1840
wicked	1840
suitors	1840
like	1840
a	1840
lioness	1840
caught	1840
in	1840
the	1840
toils	1840
with	1840
huntsmen	1840
hemming	1841
her	1841
in	1841
on	1841
every	1841
side	1841
she	1841
thought	1841
and	1841
thought	1841
till	1841
she	1841
sank	1841
into	1842
a	1842
slumber	1842
and	1842
lay	1842
on	1842
her	1842
bed	1842
bereft	1842
of	1842
thought	1842
and	1842
motion	1842
then	1844
minerva	1844
bethought	1844
her	1844
of	1844
another	1844
matter	1844
and	1844
made	1844
a	1844
vision	1844
in	1844
the	1845
likeness	1845
of	1845
penelope's	1845
sister	1845
iphthime	1845
daughter	1845
of	1845
icarius	1845
who	1845
had	1846
married	1846
eumelus	1846
and	1846
lived	1846
in	1846
pherae	1846
she	1846
told	1846
the	1846
vision	1846
to	1846
go	1846
to	1847
the	1847
house	1847
of	1847
ulysses	1847
and	1847
to	1847
make	1847
penelope	1847
leave	1847
off	1847
crying	1847
so	1847
it	1848
came	1848
into	1848
her	1848
room	1848
by	1848
the	1848
hole	1848
through	1848
which	1848
the	1848
thong	1848
went	1848
for	1848
pulling	1849
the	1849
door	1849
to	1849
and	1849
hovered	1849
over	1849
her	1849
head	1849
saying	1849
you	1851
are	1851
asleep	1851
penelope	1851
the	1851
gods	1851
who	1851
live	1851
at	1851
ease	1851
will	1851
not	1851
suffer	1851
you	1852
to	1852
weep	1852
and	1852
be	1852
so	1852
sad	1852
your	1852
son	1852
has	1852
done	1852
them	1852
no	1852
wrong	1852
so	1852
he	1852
will	1853
yet	1853
come	1853
back	1853
to	1853
you	1853
penelope	1855
who	1855
was	1855
sleeping	1855
sweetly	1855
at	1855
the	1855

voyage	1922
of	1922
twenty	1922
days	1922
upon	1922
a	1922

he	1924
were	1924
one	1924
of	1924

in	1925
a	1925
ship	1925
to	1925
his	1925

him	1925
more	1926
bronze	1926
and	1926
gold	1926
and	1926
raiment	1926
than	1926
he	1926
would	1926
have	1926
brought	1926
back	1926
from	1926
troy	1927
if	1927

got	1927
home	1927
without	1927
disaster	1928
this	1928
is	1928
how	1928
we	1928
have	1928
settled	1928
that	1928
he	1928
shall	1928
return	1928
to	1928
his	1928
country	1929
and	1929
his	1929
friends	1929
thus	1931
he	1931
spoke	1931
and	1931
mercury	1931
guide	1931
and	1931
guardian	1931
slayer	1931
of	1931
argus	1931
did	1931
as	1932
he	1932
was	1932
told	1932
forthwith	1932
he	1932
bound	1932
on	1932
his	1932
glittering	1932
golden	1932
sandals	1932
with	1933
which	1933
he	1933
could	1933
fly	1933
like	1933
the	1933
wind	1933
over	1933
land	1933
and	1933
sea	1933
he	1933
took	1933
the	1933
wand	1934
with	1934
which	1934
he	1934
seals	1934
men's	1934
eyes	1934
in	1934
sleep	1934
or	1934
wakes	1934
them	1934
just	1934
as	1934
he	1935
pleases	1935
and	1935
flew	1935
holding	1935
it	1935
in	1935
his	1935
hand	1935
over	1935
pieria	1935
then	1935
he	1935
swooped	1935
down	1936
through	1936
the	1936
firmament	1936
till	1936
he	1936
reached	1936
the	1936
level	1936
of	1936
the	1936
sea	1936
whose	1936
waves	1937
he	1937
skimmed	1937
like	1937
a	1937
cormorant	1937
that	1937
flies	1937
fishing	1937
every	1937
hole	1937
and	1937
corner	1938
of	1938
the	1938
ocean	1938
and	1938
drenching	1938
its	1938
thick	1938
plumage	1938
in	1938
the	1938
spray	1938
he	1939
flew	1939
and	1939
flew	1939
over	1939
many	1939
a	1939
weary	1939
wave	1939
but	1939
when	1939
at	1939
last	1939
he	1939
got	1939
to	1939
the	1940
island	1940
which	1940
was	1940
his	1940
journey's	1940
end	1940
he	1940
left	1940
the	1940
sea	1940
and	1940
went	1940
on	1940
by	1941
land	1941
till	1941
he	1941
came	1941
to	1941
the	1941
cave	1941
where	1941
the	1941
nymph	1941
calypso	1941
lived	1941
he	1943
found	1943
her	1943
at	1943
home	1943
there	1943
was	1943
a	1943
large	1943
fire	1943
burning	1943
on	1943
the	1943
hearth	1943
and	1944
one	1944
could	1944
smell	1944
from	1944
far	1944
the	1944
fragrant	1944
reek	1944
of	1944
burning	1944
cedar	1944
and	1944
sandal	1945
wood	1945
as	1945
for	1945
herself	1945
she	1945
was	1945
busy	1945
at	1945
her	1945
loom	1945
shooting	1945
her	1945
golden	1946
shuttle	1946
through	1946
the	1946
warp	1946
and	1946
singing	1946
beautifully	1946
round	1946
her	1946
cave	1947
there	1947
was	1947
a	1947
thick	1947
wood	1947
of	1947
alder	1947
poplar	1947
and	1947
sweet	1947
smelling	1947
cypress	1947
trees	1948
wherein	1948
all	1948
kinds	1948
of	1948
great	1948
birds	1948
had	1948
built	1948
their	1948
nests	1948
owls	1948
hawks	1949
and	1949
chattering	1949
sea-crows	1949

their	1949
business	1949
in	1949
the	1949

grew	1950
luxuriantly	1950
about	1951
the	1951
mouth	1951
of	1951
the	1951
cave	1951
there	1951

in	1952
channels	1952
cut	1952
pretty	1952
close	1952
together	1952
and	1952
turned	1952
hither	1952
and	1952
thither	1953
so	1953
as	1953
to	1953
irrigate	1953
the	1953
beds	1953
of	1953
violets	1953
and	1953
luscious	1953
herbage	1953
over	1954
which	1954
they	1954
flowed	1954
even	1954
a	1954
god	1954
could	1954
not	1954
help	1954
being	1954
charmed	1954
with	1954
such	1955
a	1955
lovely	1955
spot	1955
so	1955
mercury	1955
stood	1955
still	1955
and	1955
looked	1955
at	1955
it	1955
but	1955
when	1955
he	1956
had	1956
admired	1956
it	1956
sufficiently	1956
he	1956
went	1956
inside	1956
the	1956
cave	1956
calypso	1958
knew	1958
him	1958
at	1958
once	1958
for	1958
the	1958
gods	1958
all	1958

each	1958
other	1958
no	1958

how	1959
far	1959

another	1959
but	1959
ulysses	1959

not	1959
within	1959
he	1959
was	1960
on	1960
the	1960
sea-shore	1960
as	1960
usual	1960
looking	1960
out	1960
upon	1960
the	1960
barren	1960
ocean	1960
with	1960
tears	1961
in	1961
his	1961
eyes	1961
groaning	1961
and	1961
breaking	1961
his	1961
heart	1961
for	1961
sorrow	1961
calypso	1961
gave	1962
mercury	1962
a	1962
seat	1962
and	1962

and	1965
let	1965
me	1965
set	1965
refreshment	1965
before	1965

drew	1968
a	1968
table	1968
loaded	1968
with	1968
ambrosia	1968
beside	1968
him	1968
and	1968
mixed	1969
him	1969
some	1969
red	1969
nectar	1969
so	1969
mercury	1969

and	1969
drank	1969
till	1969
he	1969
had	1969
had	1969
enough	1970

way	1975
over	1975
the	1975

raised	1981
both	1981
wind	1981
and	1981
waves	1981
against	1981
them	1982
so	1982
that	1982
all	1982
his	1982
brave	1982
companions	1982
perished	1982
and	1982
he	1982
alone	1982

this	1988
you	1988
gods	1988
she	1988
exclaimed	1988

ashamed	1989
of	1989
yourselves	1989
you	1989
are	1989
always	1989
jealous	1989
and	1989

take	1990
a	1990
fancy	1990
to	1990

and	1990
live	1990
with	1990
him	1990
in	1990
open	1990
matrimony	1991
so	1991
when	1991

to	1991
orion	1991
you	1991
precious	1991

and	1992
killed	1992
him	1992
in	1992
ortygia	1992
so	1993
again	1993
when	1993

fell	1993
in	1993
love	1993
with	1993
iasion	1993
and	1993

long	1995
and	1995

now	1995
you	1995
are	1995
angry	1995
with	1996
me	1996
too	1996
because	1996

a	1996
man	1996

sitting	1996
all	1997
alone	1997
astride	1997
of	1997

and	1998
sunk	1998
it	1998
in	1998
mid	1998

so	1998
that	1998
all	1998
his	1998
crew	1998
were	1998
drowned	1998
while	1998
he	1999
himself	1999

driven	1999
by	1999

on	1999
to	1999
my	1999
island	1999

my	2000
heart	2000
on	2000
making	2000
him	2000
immortal	2000
so	2001
that	2001

should	2001
never	2001
grow	2001
old	2001
all	2001
his	2001
days	2001
still	2001

such	2005
advice	2005
in	2005

jove's	2012
message	2012

found	2012
him	2012
sitting	2012
upon	2012
the	2012
beach	2012
with	2013
his	2013
eyes	2013
ever	2013
filled	2013
with	2013
tears	2013
and	2013
dying	2013
of	2013
sheer	2013
home-sickness	2013
for	2014
he	2014
had	2014
got	2014
tired	2014
of	2014
calypso	2014
and	2014
though	2014
he	2014
was	2014
forced	2014
to	2014
sleep	2014
with	2015
her	2015
in	2015
the	2015
cave	2015
by	2015

so	2016
as	2016
for	2016
the	2016
day	2016
time	2016
he	2016
spent	2016
it	2016
on	2016
the	2016
rocks	2016
and	2016
on	2016
the	2016
sea-shore	2016
weeping	2017
crying	2017
aloud	2017
for	2017
his	2017

always	2017
looking	2017
out	2017
upon	2017
the	2018

came	2048
to	2048
calypso's	2048
cave	2048
where	2048
ulysses	2048

the	2049

her	2050
maids	2050
brought	2050
ambrosia	2050
and	2050
nectar	2050
for	2050
herself	2051
and	2051
they	2051
laid	2051
their	2051
hands	2051
on	2051
the	2051
good	2051
things	2051
that	2051
were	2051
before	2051

once	2056

only	2056
know	2056
how	2056
much	2057
suffering	2057
is	2057
in	2057
store	2057
for	2057
you	2057
before	2057

get	2057
back	2057
to	2057
your	2057
own	2057
country	2058

keep	2058
house	2058
along	2058
with	2058

thinking	2060
all	2060
the	2060
time	2060
day	2060
after	2060

myself	2061
that	2061
at	2061
am	2061
no	2061
whit	2061
less	2061
tall	2061
or	2061
well-looking	2061
than	2062
she	2062
is	2062
for	2062
it	2062
is	2062
not	2062
to	2062
be	2062
expected	2062
that	2062
a	2062
mortal	2062
woman	2062
should	2062
compare	2063
in	2063
beauty	2063
with	2063
an	2063
immortal	2063
goddess	2065
replied	2065
ulysses	2065
do	2065
not	2065
be	2065
angry	2065
with	2065
me	2065
about	2065
this	2065
i	2065
am	2066
quite	2066
aware	2066
that	2066
my	2066
wife	2066
penelope	2066
is	2066
nothing	2066
like	2066
so	2066
tall	2066
or	2066
so	2066
beautiful	2067
as	2067
yourself	2067
she	2067
is	2067
only	2067
a	2067
woman	2067
whereas	2067
you	2067
are	2067
an	2067
immortal	2067
nevertheless	2068
i	2068
want	2068
to	2068
get	2068
home	2068
and	2068
can	2068
think	2068
of	2068
nothing	2068
else	2068
if	2068
some	2069
god	2069
wrecks	2069
me	2069
when	2069
i	2069
am	2069
on	2069
the	2069
sea	2069
i	2069
will	2069
bear	2069
it	2069
and	2069
make	2069
the	2069
best	2070
of	2070
it	2070
i	2070
have	2070
had	2070
infinite	2070
trouble	2070
both	2070
by	2070
land	2070
and	2070
sea	2070
already	2070
so	2071
let	2071
this	2071
go	2071
with	2071
the	2071
rest	2071
presently	2073
the	2073
sun	2073
set	2073
and	2073
it	2073
became	2073
dark	2073
whereon	2073
the	2073
pair	2073
retired	2073
into	2074
the	2074
inner	2074
part	2074
of	2074
the	2074
cave	2074
and	2074
went	2074
to	2074
bed	2074
when	2076
the	2076
child	2076
of	2076
morning	2076
rosy-fingered	2076
dawn	2076
appeared	2076
ulysses	2076
put	2076
on	2077
his	2077
shirt	2077
and	2077
cloak	2077
while	2077
the	2077
goddess	2077
wore	2077
a	2077
dress	2077
of	2077
a	2077
light	2077
gossamer	2078
fabric	2078
very	2078
fine	2078
and	2078
graceful	2078
with	2078
a	2078
beautiful	2078
golden	2078
girdle	2078
about	2079
her	2079
waist	2079
and	2079
a	2079
veil	2079
to	2079
cover	2079
her	2079
head	2079
she	2079
at	2079
once	2079
set	2079
herself	2079
to	2080
think	2080
how	2080
she	2080
could	2080
speed	2080
ulysses	2080
on	2080
his	2080
way	2080
so	2080
she	2080
gave	2080
him	2080
a	2080
great	2081
bronze	2081
axe	2081
that	2081
suited	2081
his	2081
hands	2081
it	2081
was	2081
sharpened	2081
on	2081
both	2081
sides	2081
and	2082
had	2082
a	2082
beautiful	2082
olive-wood	2082
handle	2082
fitted	2082
firmly	2082
on	2082
to	2082
it	2082
she	2082
also	2083
gave	2083
him	2083
a	2083
sharp	2083
adze	2083
and	2083
then	2083
led	2083
the	2083
way	2083
to	2083
the	2083
far	2083
end	2083
of	2083
the	2084
island	2084
where	2084
the	2084
largest	2084
trees	2084
grew	2084
alder	2084
poplar	2084
and	2084
pine	2084
that	2084
reached	2085
the	2085
sky	2085
very	2085
dry	2085
and	2085
well	2085
seasoned	2085
so	2085
as	2085
to	2085
sail	2085
light	2085
for	2085
him	2086
in	2086
the	2086
water	2086
then	2086
when	2086
she	2086
had	2086
shown	2086
him	2086
where	2086
the	2086
best	2086
trees	2086
grew	2087
calypso	2087
went	2087
home	2087
leaving	2087
him	2087
to	2087
cut	2087
them	2087
which	2087
he	2087
soon	2087
finished	2087
doing	2088
he	2088
cut	2088
down	2088
twenty	2088
trees	2088
in	2088
all	2088
and	2088
adzed	2088
them	2088
smooth	2088
squaring	2088
them	2089
by	2089
rule	2089
in	2089
good	2089
workmanlike	2089
fashion	2089
meanwhile	2089
calypso	2089
came	2089
back	2089
with	2090
some	2090
augers	2090
so	2090
he	2090
bored	2090
holes	2090
with	2090
them	2090
and	2090
fitted	2090
the	2090
timbers	2090
together	2091
with	2091
bolts	2091
and	2091
rivets	2091
he	2091
made	2091
the	2091
raft	2091
as	2091
broad	2091
as	2091
a	2091
skilled	2091
shipwright	2092
makes	2092
the	2092
beam	2092
of	2092
a	2092
large	2092
vessel	2092
and	2092
he	2092
filed	2092
a	2092
deck	2092
on	2092
top	2093
of	2093
the	2093
ribs	2093
and	2093
ran	2093
a	2093
gunwale	2093
all	2093
round	2093
it	2093
he	2093
also	2093
made	2093
a	2093
mast	2093
with	2094
a	2094
yard	2094
arm	2094
and	2094
a	2094
rudder	2094
to	2094
steer	2094
with	2094
he	2094
fenced	2094
the	2094
raft	2094
all	2094
round	2095
with	2095
wicker	2095
hurdles	2095
as	2095
a	2095
protection	2095
against	2095
the	2095
waves	2095
and	2095
then	2095
he	2096
threw	2096
on	2096
a	2096
quantity	2096
of	2096
wood	2096
by	2096
and	2096
by	2096
calypso	2096
brought	2096
him	2096
some	2096
linen	2097
to	2097
make	2097
the	2097
sails	2097
and	2097
he	2097
made	2097
these	2097
too	2097
excellently	2097
making	2097
them	2098
fast	2098
with	2098
braces	2098
and	2098
sheets	2098
last	2098
of	2098
all	2098
with	2098
the	2098
help	2098
of	2098
levers	2098
he	2099
drew	2099
the	2099
raft	2099
down	2099
into	2099
the	2099
water	2099
in	2101
four	2101
days	2101
he	2101
had	2101
completed	2101
the	2101
whole	2101
work	2101
and	2101
on	2101
the	2101
fifth	2101
calypso	2101
sent	2102
him	2102
from	2102
the	2102
island	2102
after	2102
washing	2102
him	2102
and	2102
giving	2102
him	2102
some	2102
clean	2102
clothes	2103
she	2103
gave	2103
him	2103
a	2103
goat	2103
skin	2103
full	2103
of	2103
black	2103
wine	2103
and	2103
another	2103
larger	2104
one	2104
of	2104
water	2104
she	2104
also	2104
gave	2104
him	2104
a	2104
wallet	2104
full	2104
of	2104
provisions	2104
and	2105
found	2105
him	2105
in	2105
much	2105
good	2105
meat	2105
moreover	2105
she	2105
made	2105
the	2105
wind	2105
fair	2105
and	2106
warm	2106
for	2106
him	2106
and	2106
gladly	2106
did	2106
ulysses	2106
spread	2106
his	2106
sail	2106
before	2106
it	2106
while	2107
he	2107
sat	2107
and	2107
guided	2107
the	2107
raft	2107
skilfully	2107
by	2107
means	2107
of	2107
the	2107
rudder	2107
he	2108
never	2108
closed	2108
his	2108
eyes	2108
but	2108
kept	2108
them	2108
fixed	2108
on	2108
the	2108
pleiads	2108
on	2108
late-setting	2108
bootes	2109
and	2109
on	2109
the	2109
bear	2109
which	2109
men	2109
also	2109
call	2109
the	2109
wain	2109
and	2109
which	2109
turns	2109
round	2110
and	2110
round	2110
where	2110
it	2110
is	2110
facing	2110
orion	2110
and	2110
alone	2110
never	2110
dipping	2110
into	2111
the	2111
stream	2111
of	2111
oceanus	2111
for	2111
calypso	2111
had	2111
told	2111
him	2111
to	2111
keep	2111
this	2111
to	2112
his	2112
left	2112
days	2112
seven	2112
and	2112
ten	2112
did	2112
he	2112
sail	2112
over	2112
the	2112
sea	2112
and	2112
on	2112
the	2112
eighteenth	2113
the	2113
dim	2113
outlines	2113
of	2113
the	2113
mountains	2113
on	2113
the	2113
nearest	2113
part	2113
of	2113
the	2114
phaeacian	2114
coast	2114
appeared	2114
rising	2114
like	2114
a	2114
shield	2114
on	2114
the	2114
horizon	2114
but	2116
king	2116
neptune	2116
who	2116
was	2116
returning	2116
from	2116
the	2116
ethiopians	2116
caught	2116
sight	2116
of	2117
ulysses	2117
a	2117
long	2117
way	2117
off	2117
from	2117
the	2117
mountains	2117
of	2117
the	2117
solymi	2117
he	2117
could	2117
see	2118
him	2118
sailing	2118
upon	2118
the	2118
sea	2118
and	2118
it	2118
made	2118
him	2118
very	2118
angry	2118
so	2118
he	2118
wagged	2118
his	2119
head	2119
and	2119
muttered	2119
to	2119
himself	2119
saying	2119
heavens	2119
so	2119
the	2119
gods	2119
have	2119
been	2120
changing	2120
their	2120
minds	2120
about	2120
ulysses	2120
while	2120
i	2120
was	2120
away	2120
in	2120
ethiopia	2120
and	2121
now	2121
he	2121
is	2121
close	2121
to	2121
the	2121
land	2121
of	2121
the	2121
phaeacians	2121
where	2121
it	2121
is	2121
decreed	2121
that	2122
he	2122
shall	2122
escape	2122
from	2122
the	2122
calamities	2122
that	2122
have	2122
befallen	2122
him	2122
still	2122
he	2123
shall	2123
have	2123
plenty	2123
of	2123
hardship	2123
yet	2123
before	2123
he	2123
has	2123
done	2123
with	2123
it	2123
thereon	2125
he	2125
gathered	2125
his	2125
clouds	2125
together	2125
grasped	2125
his	2125
trident	2125
stirred	2125
it	2126
round	2126
in	2126
the	2126
sea	2126
and	2126
roused	2126
the	2126
rage	2126
of	2126
every	2126
wind	2126
that	2126
blows	2126
till	2127
earth	2127
sea	2127
and	2127
sky	2127
were	2127
hidden	2127
in	2127
cloud	2127
and	2127
night	2127
sprang	2127
forth	2127
out	2128
of	2128
the	2128
heavens	2128
winds	2128
from	2128
east	2128
south	2128
north	2128
and	2128
west	2128
fell	2128
upon	2128
him	2129
all	2129
at	2129
the	2129
same	2129
time	2129
and	2129
a	2129
tremendous	2129
sea	2129
got	2129
up	2129
so	2129
that	2129
ulysses	2129
heart	2130
began	2130
to	2130
fail	2130
him	2130
alas	2130
he	2130
said	2130
to	2130
himself	2130
in	2130
his	2130
dismay	2130
what	2131
ever	2131
will	2131
become	2131
of	2131
me	2131
i	2131
am	2131
afraid	2131
calypso	2131
was	2131
right	2131
when	2131
she	2131
said	2132
i	2132
should	2132
have	2132
trouble	2132
by	2132
sea	2132
before	2132
i	2132
got	2132
back	2132
home	2132
it	2132
is	2132
all	2132
coming	2133
true	2133
how	2133
black	2133
is	2133
jove	2133
making	2133
heaven	2133
with	2133
his	2133
clouds	2133
and	2133
what	2134
a	2134
sea	2134
the	2134
winds	2134
are	2134
raising	2134
from	2134
every	2134
quarter	2134
at	2134
once	2134
i	2134
am	2134
now	2135
safe	2135
to	2135
perish	2135
blest	2135
and	2135
thrice	2135
blest	2135
were	2135
those	2135
danaans	2135
who	2135
fell	2136
before	2136
troy	2136
in	2136
the	2136
cause	2136
of	2136
the	2136
sons	2136
of	2136
atreus	2136
would	2136
that	2136
had	2136
been	2137
killed	2137
on	2137
the	2137
day	2137
when	2137
the	2137
trojans	2137
were	2137
pressing	2137
me	2137
so	2137
sorely	2137
about	2138
the	2138
dead	2138
body	2138
of	2138
achilles	2138
for	2138
then	2138
i	2138
should	2138
have	2138
had	2138
due	2138
burial	2138
and	2139
the	2139
achaeans	2139
would	2139
have	2139
honoured	2139
my	2139
name	2139
but	2139
now	2139
it	2139
seems	2139
that	2139
i	2140
shall	2140
come	2140
to	2140
a	2140
most	2140
pitiable	2140
end	2140
as	2142
he	2142
spoke	2142
a	2142
sea	2142
broke	2142
over	2142
him	2142
with	2142
such	2142
terrific	2142
fury	2142
that	2142
the	2142
raft	2143
reeled	2143
again	2143
and	2143
he	2143
was	2143
carried	2143
overboard	2143
a	2143
long	2143
way	2143
off	2143
he	2143
let	2144
go	2144
the	2144
helm	2144
and	2144
the	2144
force	2144
of	2144
the	2144
hurricane	2144
was	2144
so	2144
great	2144
that	2144
it	2145
broke	2145
the	2145
mast	2145
half	2145
way	2145
up	2145
and	2145
both	2145
sail	2145
and	2145
yard	2145
went	2145
over	2145
into	2145
the	2146
sea	2146
for	2146
a	2146
long	2146
time	2146
ulysses	2146
was	2146
under	2146
water	2146
and	2146
it	2146
was	2146
all	2146
he	2146
could	2147
do	2147
to	2147
rise	2147
to	2147
the	2147
surface	2147
again	2147
for	2147
the	2147
clothes	2147
calypso	2147
had	2147
given	2148
him	2148
weighed	2148
him	2148
down	2148
but	2148
at	2148
last	2148
he	2148
got	2148
his	2148
head	2148
above	2148
water	2148
and	2149
spat	2149
out	2149
the	2149
bitter	2149
brine	2149
that	2149
was	2149
running	2149
down	2149
his	2149
face	2149
in	2149
streams	2149
in	2150
spite	2150
of	2150
all	2150
this	2150
however	2150
he	2150
did	2150
not	2150
lose	2150
sight	2150
of	2150
his	2150
raft	2150
but	2151
swam	2151
as	2151
fast	2151
as	2151
he	2151
could	2151
towards	2151
it	2151
got	2151
hold	2151
of	2151
it	2151
and	2151
climbed	2151
on	2152
board	2152
again	2152
so	2152
as	2152
to	2152
escape	2152
drowning	2152
the	2152
sea	2152
took	2152
the	2152
raft	2152
and	2152
tossed	2153
it	2153
about	2153
as	2153
autumn	2153
winds	2153
whirl	2153
thistledown	2153
round	2153
and	2153
round	2153
upon	2154
a	2154
road	2154
it	2154
was	2154
as	2154
though	2154
the	2154
south	2154
north	2154
east	2154
and	2154
west	2154
winds	2154
were	2155
all	2155
playing	2155
battledore	2155
and	2155
shuttlecock	2155
with	2155
it	2155
at	2155
once	2155
when	2157
he	2157
was	2157
in	2157
this	2157
plight	2157
ino	2157
daughter	2157
of	2157
cadmus	2157
also	2157
called	2157
leucothea	2157
saw	2158
him	2158
she	2158
had	2158
formerly	2158
been	2158
a	2158
mere	2158
mortal	2158
but	2158
had	2158
been	2158
since	2158
raised	2158
to	2159
the	2159
rank	2159
of	2159
a	2159
marine	2159
goddess	2159
seeing	2159
in	2159
what	2159
great	2159
distress	2159
ulysses	2159
now	2160
was	2160
she	2160
had	2160
compassion	2160
upon	2160
him	2160
and	2160
rising	2160
like	2160
a	2160
sea-gull	2160
from	2161
the	2161
waves	2161
took	2161
her	2161
seat	2161
upon	2161
the	2161
raft	2161
my	2163
poor	2163
good	2163
man	2163
said	2163
she	2163
why	2163
is	2163
neptune	2163
so	2163
furiously	2163
angry	2163
with	2163
you	2164
he	2164
is	2164
giving	2164
you	2164
a	2164
great	2164
deal	2164
of	2164
trouble	2164
but	2164
for	2164
all	2164
his	2164
bluster	2164
he	2165
will	2165
not	2165
kill	2165
you	2165
you	2165
seem	2165
to	2165
be	2165
a	2165
sensible	2165
person	2165
do	2165
then	2165
as	2165
i	2166
bid	2166
you	2166
strip	2166
leave	2166
your	2166
raft	2166
to	2166
drive	2166
before	2166
the	2166
wind	2166
and	2166
swim	2166
to	2167
the	2167
phaecian	2167
coast	2167
where	2167
better	2167
luck	2167
awaits	2167
you	2167
and	2167
here	2167
take	2167
my	2168
veil	2168
and	2168
put	2168
it	2168
round	2168
your	2168
chest	2168
it	2168
is	2168
enchanted	2168
and	2168
you	2168
can	2168
come	2169
to	2169
no	2169
harm	2169
so	2169
long	2169
as	2169
you	2169
wear	2169
it	2169
as	2169
soon	2169
as	2169
you	2169
touch	2169
land	2169
take	2170
it	2170
off	2170
throw	2170
it	2170
back	2170
as	2170
far	2170
as	2170
you	2170
can	2170
into	2170
the	2170
sea	2170
and	2170
then	2170
go	2171
away	2171
again	2171
with	2171
these	2171
words	2171
she	2171
took	2171
off	2171
her	2171
veil	2171
and	2171
gave	2171
it	2171
him	2172
then	2172
she	2172
dived	2172
down	2172
again	2172
like	2172
a	2172
sea-gull	2172
and	2172
vanished	2172
beneath	2172
the	2173
dark	2173
blue	2173
waters	2173
but	2175
ulysses	2175
did	2175
not	2175
know	2175
what	2175
to	2175
think	2175
alas	2175
he	2175
said	2175
to	2175
himself	2175
in	2176
his	2176
dismay	2176
this	2176
is	2176
only	2176
some	2176
one	2176
or	2176
other	2176
of	2176
the	2176
gods	2176
who	2176
is	2176
luring	2177
me	2177
to	2177
ruin	2177
by	2177
advising	2177
me	2177
to	2177
will	2177
quit	2177
my	2177
raft	2177
at	2177
any	2177
rate	2177
i	2178
will	2178
not	2178
do	2178
so	2178
at	2178
present	2178
for	2178
the	2178
land	2178
where	2178
she	2178
said	2178
i	2178
should	2178
be	2179
quit	2179
of	2179
all	2179
troubles	2179
seemed	2179
to	2179
be	2179
still	2179
a	2179
good	2179
way	2179
off	2179
i	2179
know	2179
what	2180
i	2180
will	2180
do	2180
i	2180
am	2180
sure	2180
it	2180
will	2180
be	2180
best	2180
no	2180
matter	2180
what	2180
happens	2180
i	2181
will	2181
stick	2181
to	2181
the	2181
raft	2181
as	2181
long	2181
as	2181
her	2181
timbers	2181
hold	2181
together	2181
but	2181
when	2182
the	2182
sea	2182
breaks	2182
her	2182
up	2182
i	2182
will	2182
swim	2182
for	2182
it	2182
i	2182
do	2182
not	2182
see	2182
how	2182
i	2182
can	2183
do	2183
any	2183
better	2183
than	2183
this	2183
while	2185
he	2185
was	2185
thus	2185
in	2185
two	2185
minds	2185
neptune	2185
sent	2185
a	2185
terrible	2185
great	2185
wave	2185
that	2186
seemed	2186
to	2186
rear	2186
itself	2186
above	2186
his	2186
head	2186
till	2186
it	2186
broke	2186
right	2186
over	2186
the	2187
raft	2187
which	2187
then	2187
went	2187
to	2187
pieces	2187
as	2187
though	2187
it	2187
were	2187
a	2187
heap	2187
of	2187
dry	2187
chaff	2188
tossed	2188
about	2188
by	2188
a	2188
whirlwind	2188
ulysses	2188
got	2188
astride	2188
of	2188
one	2188
plank	2188
and	2189
rode	2189
upon	2189
it	2189
as	2189
if	2189
he	2189
were	2189
on	2189
horseback	2189
he	2189
then	2189
took	2189
off	2189
the	2189
clothes	2190
calypso	2190
had	2190
given	2190
him	2190
bound	2190
ino's	2190
veil	2190
under	2190
his	2190
arms	2190
and	2190
plunged	2191
into	2191
the	2191
sea	2191
meaning	2191
to	2191
swim	2191
on	2191
shore	2191
king	2191
neptune	2191
watched	2191
him	2192
as	2192
he	2192
did	2192
so	2192
and	2192
wagged	2192
his	2192
head	2192
muttering	2192
to	2192
himself	2192
and	2192
saying	2192
there	2193
now	2193
swim	2193
up	2193
and	2193
down	2193
as	2193
you	2193
best	2193
can	2193
till	2193
you	2193
fall	2193
in	2193
with	2193
well-to-do	2194
people	2194
i	2194
do	2194
not	2194
think	2194
you	2194
will	2194
be	2194
able	2194
to	2194
say	2194
that	2194
i	2194
have	2194
let	2195
you	2195
off	2195
too	2195
lightly	2195
on	2195
this	2195
he	2195
lashed	2195
his	2195
horses	2195
and	2195
drove	2195
to	2195
aegae	2196
where	2196
his	2196
palace	2196
is	2196
but	2198
minerva	2198
resolved	2198
to	2198
help	2198
ulysses	2198
so	2198
she	2198
bound	2198
the	2198
ways	2198
of	2198
all	2198
the	2199
winds	2199
except	2199
one	2199
and	2199
made	2199
them	2199
lie	2199
quite	2199
still	2199
but	2199
she	2199
roused	2199
a	2200
good	2200
stiff	2200
breeze	2200
from	2200
the	2200
north	2200
that	2200
should	2200
lay	2200
the	2200
waters	2200
till	2200
ulysses	2201
reached	2201
the	2201
land	2201
of	2201
the	2201
phaeacians	2201
where	2201
he	2201
would	2201
be	2201
safe	2201
thereon	2203
he	2203
floated	2203
about	2203
for	2203
two	2203
nights	2203
and	2203
two	2203
days	2203
in	2203
the	2203
water	2203
with	2204
a	2204
heavy	2204
swell	2204
on	2204
the	2204
sea	2204
and	2204
death	2204
staring	2204
him	2204
in	2204
the	2204
face	2204
but	2204
when	2205
the	2205
third	2205
day	2205
broke	2205
the	2205
wind	2205
fell	2205
and	2205
there	2205
was	2205
a	2205
dead	2205
calm	2205
without	2206
so	2206
much	2206
as	2206
a	2206
breath	2206
of	2206
air	2206
stirring	2206
as	2206
he	2206
rose	2206
on	2206
the	2206
swell	2206
he	2207
looked	2207
eagerly	2207
ahead	2207
and	2207
could	2207
see	2207
land	2207
quite	2207
near	2207
then	2207
as	2207
children	2207
rejoice	2208
when	2208
their	2208
dear	2208
father	2208
begins	2208
to	2208
get	2208
better	2208
after	2208
having	2208
for	2208
a	2209
long	2209
time	2209
borne	2209
sore	2209
affliction	2209
sent	2209
him	2209
by	2209
some	2209
angry	2209
spirit	2209
but	2209
the	2210
gods	2210
deliver	2210
him	2210
from	2210
evil	2210
so	2210
was	2210

he	2210
again	2210
saw	2211
land	2211
and	2211
trees	2211
and	2211
swam	2211
on	2211
with	2211
all	2211
his	2211
strength	2211
that	2211
he	2211
might	2211
once	2212
more	2212
set	2212
foot	2212
upon	2212
dry	2212
ground	2212
when	2212
however	2212
he	2212
got	2212
within	2212
earshot	2212
he	2213
began	2213
to	2213
hear	2213
the	2213
surf	2213
thundering	2213
up	2213
against	2213
the	2213
rocks	2213
for	2213
the	2213
swell	2214
still	2214
broke	2214
against	2214
them	2214
with	2214
a	2214
terrific	2214
roar	2214
everything	2214
was	2214
enveloped	2215
in	2215
spray	2215
there	2215
were	2215
no	2215
harbours	2215
where	2215
a	2215
ship	2215
might	2215
ride	2215
nor	2216
shelter	2216
of	2216
any	2216

but	2216
only	2216

mountain	2217

heart	2219
now	2219
began	2219
to	2219
fail	2219
him	2219
and	2219
he	2219
said	2219
despairingly	2219
to	2219
himself	2220
alas	2220
jove	2220
has	2220
let	2220
me	2220
see	2220
land	2220
after	2220
swimming	2220
so	2220
far	2220
that	2220
i	2221
had	2221
given	2221
up	2221
all	2221
hope	2221
but	2221
i	2221
can	2221
find	2221
no	2221
landing	2221
place	2221
for	2221
the	2221
coast	2222
is	2222
rocky	2222
and	2222
surf-beaten	2222
the	2222
rocks	2222
are	2222
smooth	2222
and	2222
rise	2222
sheer	2222
from	2223
the	2223
sea	2223
with	2223
deep	2223
water	2223
close	2223
under	2223
them	2223
so	2223
that	2223
i	2223
cannot	2223
climb	2223
out	2224
for	2224
want	2224
of	2224
foothold	2224
i	2224
am	2224
afraid	2224
some	2224
great	2224
wave	2224
will	2224
lift	2224
me	2224
off	2225
my	2225
legs	2225
and	2225
dash	2225
me	2225
against	2225
the	2225
rocks	2225
as	2225
i	2225
leave	2225
the	2225
water	2225
which	2225
would	2226
give	2226
me	2226
a	2226
sorry	2226
landing	2226
if	2226
on	2226
the	2226
other	2226
hand	2226
i	2226
swim	2226
further	2226
in	2227
search	2227
of	2227
some	2227
shelving	2227
beach	2227
or	2227
harbour	2227
a	2227
hurricane	2227
may	2227
carry	2227
me	2228
out	2228
to	2228
sea	2228
again	2228
sorely	2228
against	2228
my	2228
will	2228
or	2228
heaven	2228
may	2228
send	2228
some	2228
great	2229
monster	2229
of	2229
the	2229
deep	2229
to	2229
attack	2229
me	2229
for	2229
amphitrite	2229
breeds	2229
many	2229
such	2230
and	2230
i	2230
know	2230
that	2230
neptune	2230
is	2230
very	2230
angry	2230
with	2230
me	2230
while	2232
he	2232
was	2232
thus	2232
in	2232
two	2232
minds	2232
a	2232
wave	2232
caught	2232
him	2232
and	2232
took	2232
him	2232
with	2232
such	2233
force	2233
against	2233
the	2233
rocks	2233
that	2233
he	2233
would	2233
have	2233
been	2233
smashed	2233
and	2233
torn	2233
to	2234
pieces	2234
if	2234
minerva	2234
had	2234
not	2234
shown	2234
him	2234
what	2234
to	2234
do	2234
he	2234
caught	2234
hold	2234
of	2235
the	2235
rock	2235
with	2235
both	2235
hands	2235
and	2235
clung	2235
to	2235
it	2235
groaning	2235
with	2235
pain	2235
till	2235
the	2236
wave	2236
retired	2236
so	2236
he	2236
was	2236
saved	2236
that	2236
time	2236
but	2236
presently	2236
the	2236
wave	2236
came	2237
on	2237
again	2237
and	2237
carried	2237
him	2237
back	2237
with	2237
it	2237
far	2237
into	2237
the	2237
sea-tearing	2237
his	2238
hands	2238
as	2238
the	2238
suckers	2238
of	2238
a	2238
polypus	2238
are	2238
torn	2238
when	2238
some	2238
one	2238
plucks	2238
it	2239
from	2239
its	2239
bed	2239
and	2239
the	2239
stones	2239
come	2239
up	2239
along	2239
with	2239
it	2239
even	2239
so	2239
did	2239
the	2240
rocks	2240
tear	2240
the	2240
skin	2240
from	2240
his	2240
strong	2240
hands	2240
and	2240
then	2240
the	2240
wave	2240
drew	2240
him	2241
deep	2241
down	2241
under	2241
the	2241
water	2241
here	2243
poor	2243
ulysses	2243
would	2243
have	2243
certainly	2243
perished	2243
even	2243
in	2243
spite	2243
of	2243
his	2243
own	2244
destiny	2244
if	2244
minerva	2244
had	2244
not	2244
helped	2244
him	2244
to	2244
keep	2244
his	2244
wits	2244
about	2244
him	2245
he	2245
swam	2245
seaward	2245
again	2245
beyond	2245
reach	2245
of	2245
the	2245
surf	2245
that	2245
was	2245
beating	2245
against	2246
the	2246
land	2246
and	2246
at	2246
the	2246
same	2246
time	2246
he	2246
kept	2246
looking	2246
towards	2246
the	2246
shore	2247
to	2247
see	2247
if	2247
he	2247
could	2247
find	2247
some	2247
haven	2247
or	2247
a	2247
spit	2247
that	2247
should	2247
take	2247
the	2248
waves	2248
aslant	2248
by	2248
and	2248
by	2248
as	2248
he	2248
swam	2248
on	2248
he	2248
came	2248
to	2248
the	2248
mouth	2248
of	2248
a	2249
river	2249
and	2249
here	2249
he	2249
thought	2249
would	2249
be	2249
the	2249
best	2249
place	2249
for	2249
there	2249
were	2249
no	2250
rocks	2250
and	2250
it	2250
afforded	2250
shelter	2250
from	2250
the	2250
wind	2250
he	2250
felt	2250
that	2250
there	2250
was	2251
a	2251
current	2251
so	2251
he	2251
prayed	2251
inwardly	2251
and	2251
said	2251
hear	2253
me	2253
o	2253
king	2253
whoever	2253
you	2253
may	2253
be	2253
and	2253
save	2253
me	2253
from	2253
the	2253
anger	2253
of	2253
the	2254
sea-god	2254
neptune	2254
for	2254
i	2254
approach	2254
you	2254
prayerfully	2254
any	2254
one	2254
who	2254
has	2254
lost	2255
his	2255
way	2255
has	2255
at	2255
all	2255
times	2255
a	2255
claim	2255
even	2255
upon	2255
the	2255
gods	2255
wherefore	2255
in	2256
my	2256
distress	2256
i	2256
draw	2256
near	2256
to	2256
your	2256
stream	2256
and	2256
cling	2256
to	2256
the	2256
knees	2256
of	2257
your	2257
riverhood	2257
have	2257
mercy	2257
upon	2257
me	2257
o	2257
king	2257
for	2257
i	2257
declare	2257
myself	2257
your	2258
suppliant	2258
then	2260
the	2260
god	2260
stayed	2260
his	2260
stream	2260
and	2260
stilled	2260
the	2260
waves	2260
making	2260
all	2260
calm	2260
before	2261
him	2261
and	2261
bringing	2261
him	2261
safely	2261
into	2261
the	2261
mouth	2261
of	2261
the	2261
river	2261
here	2261
at	2262
last	2262
ulysses	2262
knees	2262
and	2262
strong	2262
hands	2262
failed	2262
him	2262
for	2262
the	2262
sea	2262
had	2262
completely	2263
broken	2263
him	2263
his	2263
body	2263
was	2263
all	2263
swollen	2263
and	2263
his	2263
mouth	2263
and	2263
nostrils	2264
ran	2264
down	2264
like	2264
a	2264
river	2264
with	2264
sea-water	2264
so	2264
that	2264
he	2264
could	2264
neither	2264
breathe	2265
nor	2265
speak	2265
and	2265
lay	2265
swooning	2265
from	2265
sheer	2265
exhaustion	2265
presently	2265
when	2266
he	2266
had	2266
got	2266
his	2266
breath	2266
and	2266
came	2266
to	2266
himself	2266
again	2266
he	2266
took	2266
off	2266
the	2267
scarf	2267
that	2267
ino	2267
had	2267
given	2267
him	2267
and	2267
threw	2267
it	2267
back	2267
into	2267
the	2267
salt	2267
stream	2267
of	2268
the	2268
river	2268
whereon	2268
ino	2268
received	2268
it	2268
into	2268
her	2268
hands	2268
from	2268
the	2268
wave	2268
that	2269
bore	2269
it	2269
towards	2269
her	2269
then	2269
he	2269
left	2269
the	2269
river	2269
laid	2269
himself	2269
down	2269
among	2270
the	2270
rushes	2270
and	2270
kissed	2270
the	2270
bounteous	2270
earth	2270
alas	2272
he	2272
cried	2272
to	2272
himself	2272
in	2272
his	2272
dismay	2272
what	2272
ever	2272
will	2272
become	2272
of	2273
me	2273
and	2273
how	2273
is	2273
it	2273
all	2273
to	2273
end	2273
if	2273
i	2273
stay	2273
here	2273
upon	2273
the	2273
river	2273
bed	2273
through	2274
the	2274
long	2274
watches	2274
of	2274
the	2274
night	2274
i	2274
am	2274
so	2274
exhausted	2274
that	2274
the	2274
bitter	2275
cold	2275
and	2275
damp	2275
may	2275
make	2275
an	2275
end	2275
of	2275
me	2275
for	2275
towards	2275
sunrise	2275
there	2275
will	2276
be	2276
a	2276
keen	2276
wind	2276
blowing	2276
from	2276
off	2276
the	2276
river	2276
if	2276
on	2276
the	2276
other	2276
hand	2276
i	2277
climb	2277
the	2277
hill	2277
side	2277
find	2277
shelter	2277
in	2277
the	2277
woods	2277
and	2277
sleep	2277
in	2277
some	2277
thicket	2278
i	2278
may	2278
escape	2278
the	2278
cold	2278
and	2278
have	2278
a	2278
good	2278
night's	2278
rest	2278
but	2278
some	2278
savage	2279
beast	2279
may	2279
take	2279
advantage	2279
of	2279
me	2279
and	2279
devour	2279
me	2279
in	2281
the	2281
end	2281
he	2281
deemed	2281
it	2281
best	2281
to	2281
take	2281
to	2281
the	2281
woods	2281
and	2281
he	2281
found	2281
one	2281
upon	2282
some	2282
high	2282
ground	2282
not	2282
far	2282
from	2282
the	2282
water	2282
there	2282
he	2282
crept	2282
beneath	2282
two	2283
shoots	2283
of	2283
olive	2283
that	2283
grew	2283
from	2283
a	2283
single	2283
stock	2283
the	2283
one	2283
an	2283
ungrafted	2283
sucker	2284
while	2284
the	2284
other	2284
had	2284
been	2284
grafted	2284
no	2284
wind	2284
however	2284
squally	2284
could	2285
break	2285
through	2285
the	2285
cover	2285
they	2285
afforded	2285
nor	2285
could	2285
the	2285
sun's	2285
rays	2285
pierce	2286
them	2286
nor	2286
the	2286
rain	2286
get	2286
through	2286
them	2286
so	2286
closely	2286
did	2286
they	2286
grow	2286
into	2287
one	2287
another	2287
ulysses	2287
crept	2287
under	2287
these	2287
and	2287
began	2287
to	2287
make	2287
himself	2287
a	2288
bed	2288
to	2288
lie	2288
on	2288
for	2288
there	2288
was	2288
a	2288
great	2288
litter	2288
of	2288
dead	2288
leaves	2288
lying	2288
about	2289
enough	2289
to	2289
make	2289
a	2289
covering	2289
for	2289
two	2289
or	2289
three	2289
men	2289
even	2289
in	2289
hard	2289
winter	2290
weather	2290
he	2290
was	2290
glad	2290
enough	2290
to	2290
see	2290
this	2290
so	2290
he	2290
laid	2290
himself	2290
down	2291
and	2291
heaped	2291
the	2291
leaves	2291
all	2291
round	2291
him	2291
then	2291
as	2291
one	2291
who	2291
lives	2291
alone	2291
in	2292
the	2292
country	2292
far	2292
from	2292
any	2292
neighbor	2292
hides	2292
a	2292
brand	2292
as	2292
fire-seed	2292
in	2293
the	2293
ashes	2293
to	2293
save	2293
himself	2293
from	2293
having	2293
to	2293
get	2293
a	2293
light	2293
elsewhere	2293
even	2294
so	2294
did	2294
ulysses	2294
cover	2294
himself	2294
up	2294
with	2294
leaves	2294
and	2294
minerva	2294
shed	2294
a	2295
sweet	2295
sleep	2295
upon	2295
his	2295
eyes	2295
closed	2295
his	2295
eyelids	2295
and	2295
made	2295
him	2295
lose	2295
all	2296
memories	2296
of	2296
his	2296
sorrows	2296
book	2300
vi	2300
so	2302
here	2302
ulysses	2302
slept	2302
overcome	2302
by	2302
sleep	2302

was	2318
a	2318

of	2318
nausicaa	2318
and	2318
just	2318
her	2318

then	2319
coming	2319
up	2319
to	2319
the	2319

of	2319
wind	2319
she	2319
hovered	2319
over	2320
her	2320
head	2320
and	2320
said	2320
nausicaa	2322
what	2322
can	2322
your	2322

going	2324
to	2324
be	2324
married	2324
almost	2324

not	2324
only	2324
be	2324
well	2324
dressed	2325
yourself	2325
but	2325
should	2325

good	2325
clothes	2325
for	2325
those	2325
who	2325
attend	2325
you	2326

is	2326
the	2326
way	2326
to	2326

yourself	2326
a	2326
good	2326
name	2326

that	2327

courting	2330
you	2330
and	2330
you	2330
are	2330
not	2331
going	2331

a	2331
maid	2331
much	2331
longer	2331

to	2332
take	2332
the	2332

girdles	2333
and	2333
you	2333
can	2333
ride	2333
too	2333
which	2333
will	2333
be	2333
much	2333
pleasanter	2333
for	2334
you	2334
than	2334
walking	2334
for	2334
the	2334
washing-cisterns	2334
are	2334
some	2334
way	2334
from	2334
the	2334
town	2335
when	2337
she	2337
had	2337
said	2337
this	2337
minerva	2337
went	2337
away	2337
to	2337
olympus	2337
which	2337
they	2337
say	2337
is	2338
the	2338
everlasting	2338
home	2338
of	2338
the	2338
gods	2338
here	2338
no	2338
wind	2338
beats	2338
roughly	2338
and	2338
neither	2339
rain	2339
nor	2339
snow	2339
can	2339
fall	2339
but	2339
it	2339
abides	2339
in	2339
everlasting	2339
sunshine	2339
and	2340
in	2340
a	2340
great	2340
peacefulness	2340
of	2340
light	2340
wherein	2340
the	2340
blessed	2340
gods	2340
are	2340
illumined	2341
for	2341
ever	2341
and	2341
ever	2341
this	2341
was	2341
the	2341
place	2341
to	2341
which	2341
the	2341
goddess	2341
went	2342
when	2342
she	2342
had	2342
given	2342
instructions	2342
to	2342
the	2342
girl	2342
by	2344
and	2344
by	2344
morning	2344
came	2344
and	2344
woke	2344
nausicaa	2344
who	2344
began	2344
wondering	2344
about	2344
her	2345
dream	2345
she	2345
therefore	2345
went	2345
to	2345
the	2345
other	2345
end	2345
of	2345
the	2345
house	2345
to	2345
tell	2345
her	2346
father	2346
and	2346
mother	2346
all	2346
about	2346
it	2346
and	2346
found	2346
them	2346
in	2346
their	2346
own	2346
room	2346
her	2347
mother	2347
was	2347
sitting	2347
by	2347
the	2347
fireside	2347
spinning	2347
her	2347
purple	2347
yarn	2347
with	2347
her	2348
maids	2348
around	2348
her	2348
and	2348
she	2348
happened	2348
to	2348
catch	2348
her	2348
father	2348
just	2348
as	2348
he	2349
was	2349
going	2349
out	2349
to	2349
attend	2349
a	2349
meeting	2349

chief	2354
man	2354
here	2354
so	2354
it	2354

only	2354
right	2354
that	2354
you	2354
should	2354
have	2354
a	2354

when	2355

word	2360
about	2360
her	2360
own	2360
wedding	2360
for	2360

their	2392
sport	2392
along	2392
with	2392
her	2392
then	2392
is	2392
leto	2392
proud	2393
at	2393
seeing	2393
her	2393
daughter	2393
stand	2393
a	2393
full	2393
head	2393
taller	2393
than	2393
the	2393
others	2393
and	2394
eclipse	2394
the	2394
loveliest	2394
amid	2394
a	2394
whole	2394
bevy	2394
of	2394
beauties	2394
even	2394
so	2394
did	2395
the	2395
girl	2395
outshine	2395
her	2395
handmaids	2395
when	2397
it	2397
was	2397
time	2397
for	2397
them	2397
to	2397
start	2397
home	2397
and	2397
they	2397
were	2397
folding	2397
the	2397
clothes	2398
and	2398
putting	2398
them	2398
into	2398
the	2398
waggon	2398
minerva	2398
began	2398
to	2398
consider	2398
how	2399
ulysses	2399
should	2399
wake	2399
up	2399
and	2399
see	2399
the	2399
handsome	2399
girl	2399
who	2399
was	2399
to	2399
conduct	2399
him	2400
to	2400
the	2400
city	2400
of	2400
the	2400
phaeacians	2400
the	2400
girl	2400
therefore	2400
threw	2400
a	2400
ball	2400
at	2401
one	2401
of	2401
the	2401
maids	2401
which	2401
missed	2401
her	2401
and	2401
fell	2401
into	2401
deep	2401
water	2401
on	2401
this	2402
they	2402
all	2402
shouted	2402
and	2402
the	2402
noise	2402
they	2402
made	2402
woke	2402
ulysses	2402
who	2402
sat	2402
up	2403
in	2403
his	2403
bed	2403
of	2403
leaves	2403
and	2403
began	2403
to	2403
wonder	2403
what	2403
it	2403
might	2403
all	2403
be	2403
alas	2405
said	2405
he	2405
to	2405
himself	2405
what	2405
kind	2405
of	2405
people	2405
have	2405
i	2405
come	2405
amongst	2405
are	2406
they	2406
cruel	2406
savage	2406
and	2406
uncivilized	2406
or	2406
hospitable	2406
and	2406
humane	2406
i	2407
seem	2407
to	2407
hear	2407
the	2407
voices	2407
of	2407
young	2407
women	2407
and	2407
they	2407
sound	2407
like	2407
those	2407
of	2408
the	2408
nymphs	2408
that	2408
haunt	2408
mountain	2408
tops	2408
or	2408
springs	2408
of	2408
rivers	2408
and	2408
meadows	2408
of	2409
green	2409
grass	2409
at	2409
any	2409
rate	2409
i	2409
am	2409
among	2409
a	2409
race	2409
of	2409
men	2409
and	2409
women	2409
let	2409
me	2410
try	2410
if	2410
i	2410
cannot	2410
manage	2410
to	2410
get	2410
a	2410
look	2410
at	2410
them	2410
as	2412
he	2412
said	2412
this	2412
he	2412
crept	2412
from	2412
under	2412
his	2412
bush	2412
and	2412
broke	2412
off	2412
a	2412
bough	2412
covered	2413
with	2413
thick	2413
leaves	2413
to	2413
hide	2413
his	2413
nakedness	2413
he	2413
looked	2413
like	2413
some	2413
lion	2414
of	2414
the	2414
wilderness	2414
that	2414
stalks	2414
about	2414
exulting	2414
in	2414
his	2414
strength	2414
and	2415
defying	2415
both	2415
wind	2415
and	2415
rain	2415
his	2415
eyes	2415
glare	2415
as	2415
he	2415
prowls	2415
in	2415
quest	2415
of	2416
oxen	2416
sheep	2416
or	2416
deer	2416
for	2416
he	2416
is	2416
famished	2416
and	2416
will	2416
dare	2416
break	2416
even	2416
into	2417
a	2417
well-fenced	2417
homestead	2417
trying	2417
to	2417
get	2417
at	2417
the	2417
sheep	2417
even	2417
such	2417
did	2418
ulysses	2418
seem	2418
to	2418
the	2418
young	2418
women	2418
as	2418
he	2418
drew	2418
near	2418
to	2418
them	2418
all	2418
naked	2418
as	2419
he	2419
was	2419
for	2419
he	2419
was	2419
in	2419
great	2419
want	2419
on	2419
seeing	2419
one	2419
so	2419
unkempt	2419
and	2419
so	2420
begrimed	2420
with	2420
salt	2420
water	2420
the	2420
others	2420
scampered	2420
off	2420
along	2420
the	2420
spits	2420
that	2421
jutted	2421
out	2421
into	2421
the	2421
sea	2421
but	2421
the	2421
daughter	2421
of	2421
alcinous	2421
stood	2421
firm	2421
for	2422
minerva	2422
put	2422
courage	2422
into	2422
her	2422
heart	2422
and	2422
took	2422
away	2422
all	2422
fear	2422
from	2422
her	2423
she	2423
stood	2423
right	2423
in	2423
front	2423
of	2423
ulysses	2423
and	2423
he	2423
doubted	2423
whether	2423
he	2423
should	2424
go	2424
up	2424
to	2424
her	2424
throw	2424
himself	2424
at	2424
her	2424
feet	2424
and	2424
embrace	2424
her	2424
knees	2424
as	2425
a	2425
suppliant	2425
or	2425
stay	2425
where	2425
he	2425
was	2425
and	2425
entreat	2425
her	2425
to	2425
give	2425
him	2425
some	2425
clothes	2426
and	2426
show	2426
him	2426
the	2426
way	2426
to	2426
the	2426
town	2426
in	2426
the	2426
end	2426
he	2426
deemed	2426
it	2426
best	2427
to	2427
entreat	2427
her	2427
from	2427
a	2427
distance	2427
in	2427
case	2427
the	2427
girl	2427
should	2427
take	2427
offence	2427
at	2428
his	2428
coming	2428
near	2428
enough	2428
to	2428
clasp	2428
her	2428
knees	2428
so	2428
he	2428
addressed	2428
her	2428
in	2429
honeyed	2429
and	2429
persuasive	2429
language	2429
o	2431
queen	2431
he	2431
said	2431
i	2431
implore	2431
your	2431
aid	2431
but	2431
tell	2431
me	2431
are	2431
you	2431
a	2431
goddess	2431
or	2432
are	2432
you	2432
a	2432
mortal	2432
woman	2432
if	2432
you	2432
are	2432
a	2432
goddess	2432
and	2432
dwell	2432
in	2432
heaven	2432
i	2433
can	2433
only	2433
conjecture	2433
that	2433
you	2433
are	2433
jove's	2433
daughter	2433
diana	2433
for	2433
your	2433
face	2434
and	2434
figure	2434
resemble	2434
none	2434
but	2434
hers	2434
if	2434
on	2434
the	2434
other	2434
hand	2434
you	2434
are	2434
a	2435
mortal	2435
and	2435
live	2435
on	2435
earth	2435
thrice	2435
happy	2435
are	2435
your	2435
father	2435
and	2435
mother	2435
thrice	2436
happy	2436
too	2436
are	2436
your	2436
brothers	2436
and	2436
sisters	2436
how	2436
proud	2436
and	2436
delighted	2436
they	2437
must	2437
feel	2437
when	2437
they	2437
see	2437
so	2437
fair	2437
a	2437
scion	2437
as	2437
yourself	2437
going	2437
out	2437
to	2438
a	2438
dance	2438
most	2438
happy	2438
however	2438
of	2438
all	2438
will	2438
he	2438
be	2438
whose	2438
wedding	2438
gifts	2438
have	2439
been	2439
the	2439
richest	2439
and	2439
who	2439
takes	2439
you	2439
to	2439
his	2439
own	2439
home	2439
i	2439
never	2439
yet	2440
saw	2440
any	2440
one	2440
so	2440
beautiful	2440
neither	2440
man	2440
nor	2440
woman	2440
and	2440
am	2440
lost	2440
in	2440
admiration	2441
as	2441
i	2441
behold	2441
you	2441
i	2441
can	2441
only	2441
compare	2441
you	2441
to	2441
a	2441
young	2441
palm	2441
tree	2442
which	2442
i	2442
saw	2442
when	2442
i	2442
was	2442
at	2442
delos	2442
growing	2442
near	2442
the	2442
altar	2442
of	2442
apollo	2442
for	2443
i	2443
was	2443
there	2443
too	2443
with	2443
much	2443
people	2443
after	2443
me	2443
when	2443
i	2443
was	2443
on	2443
that	2443
journey	2444
which	2444
has	2444
been	2444
the	2444
source	2444
of	2444
all	2444
my	2444
troubles	2444
never	2444
yet	2444
did	2444
such	2445
a	2445
young	2445
plant	2445
shoot	2445
out	2445
of	2445
the	2445
ground	2445
as	2445
that	2445
was	2445
and	2445
i	2445
admired	2445
and	2446
wondered	2446
at	2446
it	2446
exactly	2446
as	2446
i	2446
now	2446
admire	2446
and	2446
wonder	2446
at	2446
yourself	2446
i	2447
dare	2447
not	2447
clasp	2447
your	2447
knees	2447
but	2447
i	2447
am	2447
in	2447
great	2447
distress	2447
yesterday	2447
made	2448
the	2448
twentieth	2448
day	2448
that	2448
i	2448
had	2448
been	2448
tossing	2448
about	2448
upon	2448
the	2448
sea	2448
the	2449
winds	2449
and	2449
waves	2449
have	2449
taken	2449
me	2449
all	2449
the	2449
way	2449
from	2449
the	2449
ogygian	2449
island	2449
and	2450
now	2450
fate	2450
has	2450
flung	2450
me	2450
upon	2450
this	2450
coast	2450
that	2450
i	2450
may	2450
endure	2450
still	2450
further	2451
suffering	2451
for	2451
i	2451
do	2451
not	2451
think	2451
that	2451
i	2451
have	2451
yet	2451
come	2451
to	2451
the	2451
end	2452
of	2452
it	2452
but	2452
rather	2452
that	2452
heaven	2452
has	2452
still	2452
much	2452
evil	2452
in	2452
store	2452
for	2452
me	2453
and	2455
now	2455
o	2455
queen	2455
have	2455
pity	2455
upon	2455
me	2455
for	2455
you	2455
are	2455
the	2455
first	2455
person	2455

have	2456
met	2456
and	2456
i	2456
know	2456
no	2456
one	2456
else	2456
in	2456
this	2456
country	2456
show	2456
me	2456
the	2456
way	2456
to	2457
your	2457
town	2457
and	2457
let	2457
me	2457
have	2457
anything	2457
that	2457
you	2457
may	2457
have	2457
brought	2457
hither	2457
to	2458
wrap	2458
your	2458
clothes	2458
in	2458
may	2458
heaven	2458
grant	2458
you	2458

is	2459
nothing	2459
better	2460
in	2460
this	2460
world	2460
than	2460
that	2460
man	2460

wife	2460
should	2460
be	2460
of	2460
one	2460

a	2461

and	2462
they	2462
themselves	2462
know	2462
more	2462

here	2476
to	2477
do	2477
us	2477
phaeacians	2477
any	2477
harm	2477
for	2477
we	2477
are	2477
dear	2477
to	2477
the	2477
gods	2477
and	2477
live	2477
apart	2478
on	2478
a	2478
land's	2478
end	2478
that	2478
juts	2478
into	2478
the	2478
sounding	2478
sea	2478
and	2478
have	2478
nothing	2478
to	2479
do	2479
with	2479
any	2479
other	2479
people	2479
this	2479
is	2479
only	2479
some	2479
poor	2479
man	2479
who	2479
has	2479
lost	2479
his	2480
way	2480
and	2480
we	2480
must	2480
be	2480
kind	2480
to	2480
him	2480
for	2480
strangers	2480
and	2480
foreigners	2480

what	2481
they	2481
can	2481
get	2482
and	2482
be	2482
thankful	2482
so	2482
girls	2482
give	2482
the	2482
poor	2482
fellow	2482
something	2482
to	2482
eat	2483
and	2483
drink	2483
and	2483
wash	2483
him	2483
in	2483
the	2483
stream	2483
at	2483
some	2483
place	2483
that	2483
is	2483
sheltered	2483
from	2484
the	2484
wind	2484
on	2486
this	2486
the	2486
maids	2486
left	2486
off	2486
running	2486
away	2486
and	2486
began	2486
calling	2486
one	2486
another	2486
back	2487
they	2487
made	2487
ulysses	2487
sit	2487
down	2487
in	2487
the	2487
shelter	2487
as	2487
nausicaa	2487
had	2487
told	2487
them	2488
and	2488
brought	2488
him	2488
a	2488
shirt	2488
and	2488
cloak	2488
they	2488
also	2488
brought	2488
him	2488
the	2488
little	2489
golden	2489
cruse	2489
of	2489
oil	2489
and	2489
told	2489
him	2489
to	2489
go	2489
wash	2489
in	2489
the	2489
stream	2489
but	2490
ulysses	2490
said	2490
young	2490
women	2490
please	2490
to	2490
stand	2490
a	2490
little	2490
on	2490
one	2490
side	2490
that	2491
i	2491
may	2491
wash	2491
the	2491
brine	2491
from	2491
my	2491
shoulders	2491
and	2491
anoint	2491
myself	2491
with	2491
oil	2492
for	2492
it	2492
is	2492
long	2492
enough	2492
since	2492
my	2492
skin	2492
has	2492
had	2492
a	2492
drop	2492
of	2492
oil	2492
upon	2492
it	2493
i	2493
cannot	2493
wash	2493
as	2493
long	2493
as	2493
you	2493
all	2493
keep	2493
standing	2493
there	2493
i	2493
am	2493
ashamed	2493
to	2494
strip	2494
before	2494
a	2494
number	2494
of	2494
good-looking	2494
young	2494
women	2494
then	2496
they	2496
stood	2496
on	2496
one	2496
side	2496
and	2496
went	2496
to	2496
tell	2496
the	2496
girl	2496
while	2496
ulysses	2496
washed	2497
himself	2497
in	2497
the	2497
stream	2497
and	2497
scrubbed	2497
the	2497
brine	2497
from	2497
his	2497
back	2497
and	2498
from	2498
his	2498
broad	2498
shoulders	2498
when	2498
he	2498
had	2498
thoroughly	2498
washed	2498
himself	2498
and	2499
had	2499
got	2499
the	2499
brine	2499
out	2499
of	2499
his	2499
hair	2499
he	2499
anointed	2499
himself	2499
with	2499
oil	2499
and	2500
put	2500
on	2500
the	2500
clothes	2500
which	2500
the	2500
girl	2500
had	2500
given	2500
him	2500
minerva	2500
then	2500
made	2501
him	2501
look	2501
taller	2501
and	2501
stronger	2501
than	2501
before	2501
she	2501
also	2501
made	2501
the	2501
hair	2501
grow	2502
thick	2502
on	2502
the	2502
top	2502
of	2502
his	2502
head	2502
and	2502
flow	2502
down	2502
in	2502
curls	2502
like	2502
hyacinth	2502
blossoms	2503
she	2503
glorified	2503
him	2503
about	2503
the	2503
head	2503
and	2503
shoulders	2503
as	2503
a	2503
skilful	2503
workman	2504
who	2504
has	2504
studied	2504
art	2504
of	2504
all	2504
kinds	2504
under	2504
vulcan	2504
and	2504
minerva	2504
enriches	2505
a	2505
piece	2505
of	2505
silver	2505
plate	2505
by	2505
gilding	2505
it	2505
and	2505
his	2505
work	2505
is	2505
full	2505
of	2506
beauty	2506
then	2506
he	2506
went	2506
and	2506
sat	2506
down	2506
a	2506
little	2506
way	2506
off	2506
upon	2506
the	2506
beach	2506
looking	2507
quite	2507
young	2507
and	2507
handsome	2507
and	2507
the	2507
girl	2507
gazed	2507
on	2507
him	2507
with	2507
admiration	2507
then	2508
she	2508
said	2508
to	2508
her	2508
maids	2508
hush	2510
my	2510
dears	2510
for	2510
i	2510
want	2510
to	2510
say	2510
something	2510
i	2510
believe	2510
the	2510
gods	2510
who	2510
live	2511
in	2511
heaven	2511
have	2511
sent	2511
this	2511
man	2511
to	2511
the	2511
phaeacians	2511
when	2511
i	2511
first	2511
saw	2512
him	2512
i	2512
thought	2512
him	2512
plain	2512
but	2512
now	2512
his	2512
appearance	2512
is	2512
like	2512
that	2512
of	2512
the	2513
gods	2513
who	2513
dwell	2513
in	2513
heaven	2513
i	2513
should	2513
like	2513
my	2513
future	2513
husband	2513
to	2513
be	2513
just	2514
such	2514
another	2514
as	2514
he	2514
is	2514
if	2514
he	2514
would	2514
only	2514
stay	2514
here	2514
and	2514
not	2514
want	2514
to	2515
go	2515
away	2515
however	2515
give	2515
him	2515
something	2515
to	2515
eat	2515
and	2515
drink	2515
they	2517
did	2517
as	2517
they	2517
were	2517
told	2517
and	2517
set	2517
food	2517
before	2517
ulysses	2517
who	2517
ate	2517
and	2517
drank	2518
ravenously	2518
for	2518
it	2518
was	2518
long	2518
since	2518
he	2518
had	2518
had	2518
food	2518
of	2518
any	2518
kind	2518
meanwhile	2519
nausicaa	2519
bethought	2519
her	2519
of	2519
another	2519
matter	2519
she	2519
got	2519
the	2519
linen	2519
folded	2520
and	2520
placed	2520
in	2520
the	2520
waggon	2520
she	2520
then	2520
yoked	2520
the	2520
mules	2520
and	2520
as	2520
she	2521
took	2521
her	2521
seat	2521
she	2521
called	2521
ulysses	2521
stranger	2523
said	2523
she	2523
rise	2523
and	2523
let	2523
us	2523
be	2523
going	2523
back	2523

the	2523
town	2523

the	2524
house	2524
of	2524
my	2524
excellent	2524
father	2524
where	2524
i	2524
can	2525
tell	2525
you	2525
that	2525
you	2525
will	2525
meet	2525
all	2525
the	2525
best	2525
people	2525
among	2525
the	2525
phaecians	2525
but	2526
be	2526
sure	2526
and	2526
do	2526
as	2526
i	2526
bid	2526
you	2526
for	2526
you	2526
seem	2526
to	2526
be	2526
a	2526
sensible	2526
person	2526
as	2527
long	2527
as	2527
we	2527
are	2527
going	2527
past	2527
the	2527
fields	2527
and	2527
farm	2527
lands	2527

briskly	2527
behind	2528
the	2528
waggon	2528
along	2528
with	2528
the	2528
maids	2528
and	2528
i	2528
will	2528
lead	2528
the	2528
way	2528
myself	2528
presently	2529
however	2529
we	2529
shall	2529
come	2529
to	2529
the	2529
town	2529
where	2529
you	2529
will	2529
find	2529
a	2530
high	2530
wall	2530
running	2530
all	2530
round	2530
it	2530
and	2530
a	2530
good	2530
harbour	2530
on	2530
either	2530
side	2530
with	2531
a	2531
narrow	2531
entrance	2531
into	2531
the	2531
city	2531
and	2531
the	2531
ships	2531
will	2531
be	2531
drawn	2531
up	2532
by	2532
the	2532
road	2532
side	2532
for	2532
every	2532
one	2532
has	2532
a	2532
place	2532
where	2532
his	2532
own	2532
ship	2532
can	2533
lie	2533
you	2533
will	2533
see	2533
the	2533
market	2533
place	2533
with	2533
a	2533
temple	2533
of	2533
neptune	2533
in	2533
the	2534
middle	2534
of	2534
it	2534
and	2534
paved	2534
with	2534
large	2534
stones	2534
bedded	2534
in	2534
the	2534
earth	2534
here	2535
people	2535
deal	2535
in	2535
ship's	2535
gear	2535
of	2535
all	2535
kinds	2535
such	2535
as	2535
cables	2535
and	2535
sails	2535
and	2536
here	2536
too	2536
are	2536
the	2536
places	2536
where	2536
oars	2536
are	2536
made	2536
for	2536
the	2536
phaeacians	2536
are	2537
not	2537
a	2537
nation	2537
of	2537
archers	2537
they	2537
know	2537
nothing	2537
about	2537
bows	2537
and	2537
arrows	2537
but	2538
are	2538
a	2538
sea-faring	2538
folk	2538
and	2538
pride	2538
themselves	2538
on	2538
their	2538
masts	2538
oars	2538
and	2539
ships	2539
with	2539
which	2539
they	2539
travel	2539
far	2539
over	2539
the	2539
sea	2539
i	2541
am	2541
afraid	2541
of	2541
the	2541
gossip	2541
and	2541
scandal	2541
that	2541
may	2541
be	2541
set	2541
on	2541
foot	2541
against	2541
me	2542
later	2542
on	2542
for	2542
the	2542
people	2542
here	2542
are	2542
very	2542
ill-natured	2542
and	2542
some	2542
low	2542
fellow	2543
if	2543
he	2543
met	2543
us	2543
might	2543
say	2543
who	2543
is	2543
this	2543
fine-looking	2543
stranger	2543
that	2544
is	2544
going	2544
about	2544
with	2544
nausicaa	2544
where	2544
did	2544
she	2544
end	2544
him	2544
i	2544
suppose	2544
she	2545
is	2545
going	2545
to	2545
marry	2545
him	2545
perhaps	2545
he	2545
is	2545
a	2545
vagabond	2545
sailor	2545
whom	2545
she	2545
has	2546
taken	2546
from	2546
some	2546
foreign	2546
vessel	2546
for	2546
we	2546
have	2546
no	2546
neighbours	2546
or	2546
some	2547
god	2547
has	2547
at	2547
last	2547
come	2547
down	2547
from	2547
heaven	2547
in	2547
answer	2547
to	2547
her	2547
prayers	2547
and	2548
she	2548
is	2548
going	2548
to	2548
live	2548
with	2548
him	2548
all	2548
the	2548
rest	2548
of	2548
her	2548
life	2548
it	2548
would	2548
be	2549
a	2549
good	2549
thing	2549
if	2549
she	2549
would	2549
take	2549
herself	2549
of	2549
i	2549
for	2549
sh	2549
and	2549
find	2549
a	2549
husband	2549
somewhere	2550
else	2550
for	2550
she	2550
will	2550
not	2550
look	2550
at	2550
one	2550
of	2550
the	2550
many	2550
excellent	2550
young	2551
phaeacians	2551
who	2551
are	2551
in	2551
with	2551
her	2551
this	2551
is	2551
the	2551
kind	2551
of	2551
disparaging	2551
remark	2552
that	2552
would	2552
be	2552
made	2552
about	2552
me	2552
and	2552
i	2552
could	2552
not	2552
complain	2552
for	2552
i	2553
should	2553
myself	2553
be	2553
scandalized	2553
at	2553
seeing	2553
any	2553
other	2553
girl	2553
do	2553
the	2553
like	2553
and	2554
go	2554
about	2554
with	2554
men	2554
in	2554
spite	2554
of	2554
everybody	2554
while	2554
her	2554
father	2554
and	2554
mother	2555
were	2555
still	2555
alive	2555
and	2555
without	2555
having	2555
been	2555
married	2555
in	2555
the	2555
face	2555
of	2556
all	2556
the	2556
world	2556
if	2558
therefore	2558
you	2558
want	2558
my	2558
father	2558
to	2558
give	2558
you	2558
an	2558
escort	2558
and	2558
to	2558
help	2558
you	2559
home	2559
do	2559
as	2559
i	2559
bid	2559
you	2559
you	2559
will	2559
see	2559
a	2559
beautiful	2559
grove	2559
of	2559
poplars	2559
by	2560
the	2560
road	2560

if	2575
you	2575

saying	2579
she	2579
lashed	2579
the	2579
mules	2579
with	2579
her	2579
whip	2579
and	2579
they	2579
left	2579
the	2579
river	2579
the	2580
mules	2580
drew	2580
well	2580
and	2580
their	2580
hoofs	2580
went	2580
up	2580
and	2580
down	2580
upon	2580
the	2580
road	2580
she	2581
was	2581
careful	2581
not	2581
to	2581
go	2581
too	2581
fast	2581
for	2581
ulysses	2581
and	2581
the	2581

following	2582
on	2582
foot	2582
along	2582
with	2582
the	2582
waggon	2582
so	2582
she	2582
plied	2582
her	2582
whip	2582
with	2582
judgement	2583
as	2583
the	2583
sun	2583
was	2583
going	2583
down	2583
they	2583
came	2583
to	2583
the	2583
sacred	2583
grove	2583
of	2584
minerva	2584
and	2584
there	2584
ulysses	2584
sat	2584
down	2584
and	2584
prayed	2584
to	2584
the	2584
mighty	2584
daughter	2584
of	2585
jove	2585
hear	2587
me	2587
he	2587
cried	2587
daughter	2587
of	2587
aegis-bearing	2587
jove	2587
unweariable	2587
hear	2588
me	2588
now	2588
for	2588
you	2588
gave	2588
no	2588
heed	2588
to	2588
my	2588
prayers	2588
when	2588
neptune	2588
was	2588
wrecking	2588
me	2589
now	2589
therefore	2589
have	2589
pity	2589
upon	2589
me	2589
and	2589
grant	2589
that	2589
i	2589
may	2589
find	2589
friends	2589
and	2590
be	2590
hospitably	2590
received	2590
by	2590
the	2590
phaecians	2590
thus	2592
did	2592
he	2592
pray	2592
and	2592
minerva	2592
heard	2592
his	2592
prayer	2592
but	2592
she	2592
would	2592
not	2592
show	2593
herself	2593
to	2593
him	2593
openly	2593
for	2593
she	2593
was	2593
afraid	2593
of	2593
her	2593
uncle	2593
neptune	2593
who	2594
was	2594
still	2594
furious	2594
in	2594
his	2594
endeavors	2594
to	2594
prevent	2594
ulysses	2594
from	2594
getting	2594
home	2595
book	2599
vii	2599
thus	2601
then	2601
did	2601
ulysses	2601
wait	2601
and	2601
pray	2601
but	2601
the	2601
girl	2601
drove	2601
on	2601
to	2601
the	2601
town	2602
when	2602
she	2602
reached	2602
her	2602
father's	2602
house	2602
she	2602
drew	2602
up	2602
at	2602
the	2602
gateway	2602
and	2603
her	2603
brothers	2603
comely	2603
as	2603
the	2603
gods	2603
gathered	2603
round	2603
her	2603
took	2603
the	2603
mules	2604
out	2604
of	2604
the	2604
waggon	2604
and	2604
carried	2604
the	2604
clothes	2604
into	2604
the	2604
house	2604
while	2604
she	2605
went	2605
to	2605
her	2605
own	2605
room	2605
where	2605
an	2605
old	2605
servant	2605
eurymedusa	2605
of	2605
apeira	2605
lit	2606
the	2606
fire	2606
for	2606
her	2606
this	2606
old	2606
woman	2606
had	2606
been	2606
brought	2606
by	2606
sea	2606
from	2606
apeira	2607
and	2607
had	2607
been	2607
chosen	2607
as	2607
a	2607
prize	2607
for	2607
alcinous	2607
because	2607
he	2607
was	2607
king	2608
over	2608
the	2608
phaecians	2608
and	2608
the	2608
people	2608
obeyed	2608
him	2608
as	2608
though	2608
he	2608
were	2608
a	2609
god	2609
she	2609
had	2609
been	2609
nurse	2609
to	2609
nausicaa	2609
and	2609
had	2609
now	2609
lit	2609
the	2609
fire	2609
for	2609
her	2610
and	2610
brought	2610
her	2610
supper	2610
for	2610
her	2610
into	2610
her	2610
own	2610
room	2610
presently	2612
ulysses	2612
got	2612
up	2612
to	2612
go	2612
towards	2612
the	2612
town	2612
and	2612
minerva	2612
shed	2612
a	2613
thick	2613
mist	2613
all	2613
round	2613
him	2613
to	2613
hide	2613
him	2613
in	2613
case	2613
any	2613
of	2613
the	2613
proud	2613
phaecians	2613
who	2614
met	2614
him	2614
should	2614
be	2614
rude	2614
to	2614
him	2614
or	2614
ask	2614
him	2614
who	2614
he	2614
was	2614
then	2614
as	2614
he	2615
was	2615
just	2615
entering	2615
the	2615
town	2615
she	2615
came	2615
towards	2615
him	2615
in	2615
the	2615
likeness	2615
of	2616
a	2616
little	2616
girl	2616
carrying	2616
a	2616
pitcher	2616
she	2616
stood	2616
right	2616
in	2616
front	2616
of	2616
him	2616
and	2617
ulysses	2617
said	2617
my	2619
dear	2619

you	2619
be	2619
so	2619
kind	2619
as	2619

house	2619
of	2619
king	2619
alcinous	2619
i	2620
am	2620
an	2620
unfortunate	2620
foreigner	2620
in	2620
distress	2620

know	2620
one	2620
in	2620
your	2621
town	2621
and	2621
country	2621
then	2623
minerva	2623

show	2623

father	2624
i	2624
will	2624
go	2625
before	2625
you	2625
and	2625
show	2625
the	2625
way	2625
but	2625
say	2625
not	2625
a	2625
word	2625
as	2625
you	2625
go	2625
and	2625
do	2626
not	2626
look	2626
at	2626
any	2626
man	2626
nor	2626
ask	2626
him	2626
questions	2626
for	2626
the	2626
people	2626
here	2626
cannot	2627
abide	2627
strangers	2627

not	2627
like	2627
men	2627

from	2627
some	2627
other	2627
place	2628

a	2628
sea-faring	2628
folk	2628
and	2628
sail	2628
the	2628
seas	2628
by	2628
the	2628
grace	2628
of	2629
neptune	2629
in	2629
ships	2629
that	2629
glide	2629
along	2629
like	2629
thought	2629
or	2629
as	2629
a	2629
bird	2629
in	2629
the	2630
air	2630
on	2632
this	2632
she	2632
led	2632
the	2632
way	2632
and	2632
ulysses	2632
followed	2632
in	2632
her	2632
steps	2632
but	2632
not	2632
one	2633
of	2633
the	2633
phaecians	2633
could	2633
see	2633
him	2633
as	2633
he	2633
passed	2633
through	2633
the	2633
city	2633

him	2635
in	2635
a	2635
thick	2635
cloud	2635
of	2635
darkness	2635
he	2635
admired	2635
their	2636

she	2667
went	2667
to	2667

to	2668
the	2668
spacious	2668

where	2668
she	2668

to	2669
the	2669
house	2669
of	2669
alcinous	2669
and	2670
he	2670
pondered	2670
much	2670
as	2670
he	2670
paused	2670
a	2670
while	2670
before	2670
reaching	2670
the	2670

of	2671
bronze	2671
for	2671
the	2671
splendour	2671
of	2671
the	2671

the	2672

over	2678
the	2679
palace	2679
of	2679
king	2679
alcinous	2679
so	2679
they	2679

never	2679
grow	2680
old	2680

at	2688
the	2688

sit	2688

spin	2688
and	2688
their	2688
shuttles	2688
go	2688
backwards	2688
and	2689
forwards	2689
like	2689
the	2689
fluttering	2689
of	2689
aspen	2689
leaves	2689
while	2689
the	2689
linen	2689
is	2690
so	2690
closely	2690
woven	2690
that	2690
it	2690
will	2690
turn	2690

the	2690
best	2691

when	2714
he	2714
had	2715
looked	2715
long	2715
enough	2715
he	2715
crossed	2715
the	2715

and	2715
went	2715
within	2715
the	2715
precincts	2716
of	2716
the	2716

there	2716
he	2716

people	2716
among	2716
the	2717

still	2719
hidden	2719
by	2719
the	2719

the	2722
miraculous	2722
darkness	2722
fell	2722
away	2722

he	2722
became	2722
visible	2723
every	2723
one	2723
was	2723
speechless	2723
with	2723

presently	2734
the	2734

thus	2736
alcinous	2738

about	2740
to	2740

take	2741
a	2741

on	2741
a	2741

it	2755
round	2755
that	2755
we	2755

make	2755
drink-offerings	2755
to	2755

the	2755

handed	2758

round	2758
after	2758
giving	2758
every	2759
man	2759
his	2759
drink-offering	2759
when	2759
they	2759
had	2759
made	2759
their	2759
offerings	2759
and	2760
had	2760
drunk	2760
each	2760
as	2760
much	2760
as	2760
he	2760
was	2760
minded	2760
alcinous	2760
said	2760
aldermen	2762
and	2762
town	2762
councillors	2762
of	2762
the	2762
phaeacians	2762
hear	2762
my	2762
words	2762
you	2762
have	2763
had	2763
your	2763
supper	2763
so	2763
now	2763
go	2763
home	2763
to	2763
bed	2763
to-morrow	2763
morning	2763
i	2763
shall	2763
invite	2764
a	2764
still	2764
larger	2764
number	2764
of	2764
aldermen	2764
and	2764
will	2764
give	2764
a	2764
sacrificial	2764
banquet	2765
in	2765
honour	2765
of	2765
our	2765
guest	2765
we	2765
can	2765
then	2765
discuss	2765
the	2765
question	2765
of	2765
his	2766
escort	2766
and	2766
consider	2766
how	2766
we	2766
may	2766
at	2766
once	2766
send	2766
him	2766
back	2766
rejoicing	2766
to	2767
his	2767
own	2767
country	2767
without	2767
trouble	2767
or	2767
inconvenience	2767
to	2767
himself	2767
no	2767
matter	2768
how	2768
distant	2768
it	2768
may	2768
be	2768
we	2768
must	2768
see	2768
that	2768
he	2768
comes	2768
to	2768
no	2768
harm	2768
while	2769
on	2769
his	2769
homeward	2769
journey	2769
but	2769
when	2769
he	2769
is	2769
once	2769
at	2769
home	2769
he	2769
will	2769
have	2770
to	2770
take	2770
the	2770
luck	2770
he	2770
was	2770
born	2770
with	2770
for	2770
better	2770
or	2770
worse	2770
like	2770
other	2770
people	2771
it	2771
is	2771
possible	2771
however	2771
that	2771
the	2771
stranger	2771
is	2771
one	2771
of	2771
the	2771
immortals	2771
who	2772
has	2772
come	2772
down	2772
from	2772
heaven	2772
to	2772
visit	2772
us	2772
but	2772
in	2772
this	2772
case	2772
the	2772
gods	2772
are	2773
departing	2773
from	2773
their	2773
usual	2773
practice	2773
for	2773
hitherto	2773
they	2773
have	2773
made	2773
themselves	2774
perfectly	2774
clear	2774
to	2774
us	2774
when	2774
we	2774
have	2774
been	2774
offering	2774
them	2774
hecatombs	2774
they	2775
come	2775
and	2775
sit	2775
at	2775
our	2775
feasts	2775
just	2775
like	2775
one	2775
of	2775
our	2775
selves	2775
and	2775
if	2775
any	2776
solitary	2776
wayfarer	2776
happens	2776
to	2776
stumble	2776
upon	2776
some	2776
one	2776
or	2776
other	2776
of	2776
them	2777
they	2777
affect	2777
no	2777
concealment	2777
for	2777
we	2777
are	2777
as	2777
near	2777
of	2777
kin	2777
to	2777
the	2777
gods	2778
as	2778
the	2778
cyclopes	2778
and	2778
the	2778
savage	2778
giants	2778
are	2778
then	2780
ulysses	2780
said	2780
pray	2780
alcinous	2780
do	2780
not	2780
take	2780
any	2780
such	2780
notion	2780
into	2780
your	2781
head	2781
i	2781
have	2781
nothing	2781
of	2781
the	2781
immortal	2781
about	2781
me	2781
neither	2781
in	2781
body	2781
nor	2782
mind	2782
and	2782
most	2782
resemble	2782
those	2782
among	2782
you	2782
who	2782
are	2782
the	2782
most	2782
afflicted	2782
indeed	2783
were	2783
i	2783
to	2783
tell	2783
you	2783
all	2783
that	2783
heaven	2783
has	2783
seen	2783
fit	2783
to	2783
lay	2783
upon	2783
me	2784
you	2784
would	2784
say	2784
that	2784
i	2784
was	2784
still	2784
worse	2784
off	2784
than	2784
they	2784
are	2784
nevertheless	2784
let	2785
me	2785
sup	2785
in	2785
spite	2785
of	2785
sorrow	2785
for	2785
an	2785
empty	2785
stomach	2785
is	2785
a	2785
very	2785
importunate	2785
thing	2786
and	2786
thrusts	2786
itself	2786
on	2786
a	2786
man's	2786
notice	2786
no	2786
matter	2786
how	2786
dire	2786
is	2786
his	2787
distress	2787
i	2787
am	2787
in	2787
great	2787
trouble	2787
yet	2787
it	2787
insists	2787
that	2787
i	2787
shall	2787
eat	2787
and	2788
drink	2788
bids	2788
me	2788
lay	2788
aside	2788
all	2788
memory	2788
of	2788
my	2788
sorrows	2788
and	2788

only	2788
on	2789
the	2789

as	2789
you	2789
propose	2789
and	2790
at	2790
break	2790
of	2790
day	2790
set	2790
about	2790
helping	2790
me	2790
to	2790
get	2790
home	2790
i	2790
shall	2790
be	2790
content	2790
to	2791
die	2791
if	2791
i	2791
may	2791
first	2791
once	2791
more	2791
behold	2791
my	2791
property	2791
my	2791
bondsmen	2791
and	2791
all	2792
the	2792
greatness	2792
of	2792
my	2792
house	2792
thus	2794
did	2794
he	2794
speak	2794
every	2794
one	2794
approved	2794
his	2794
saying	2794
and	2794
agreed	2794
that	2794
he	2795
should	2795
have	2795
his	2795
escort	2795
inasmuch	2795
as	2795
he	2795
had	2795
spoken	2795
reasonably	2795
then	2795
when	2796
they	2796
had	2796
made	2796
their	2796
drink-offerings	2796
and	2796
had	2796
drunk	2796
each	2796
as	2796
much	2796
as	2797
he	2797
was	2797
minded	2797
they	2797
went	2797
home	2797
to	2797
bed	2797
every	2797
man	2797
in	2797
his	2797
own	2797

in	2798
the	2798
cloister	2798
with	2798
arete	2798
and	2798
alcinous	2798
while	2798
the	2798

stranger	2802
before	2802
we	2802

any	2802
further	2802
there	2802
is	2802
a	2802
question	2802

here	2804
from	2804
beyond	2804
the	2804
sea	2804
and	2806
ulysses	2806
answered	2806
it	2806
would	2806
be	2806
a	2806
long	2806
story	2806
madam	2806
were	2806
i	2806
to	2806
relate	2806
in	2807
full	2807
the	2807
tale	2807
of	2807
my	2807
misfortunes	2807
for	2807
the	2807
hand	2807
of	2807
heaven	2807
has	2807
been	2807
laid	2808
heavy	2808
upon	2808
me	2808
but	2808
as	2808
regards	2808
your	2808
question	2808
there	2808
is	2808
an	2808
island	2808
far	2809
away	2809
in	2809
the	2809
sea	2809
which	2809
is	2809
called	2809
the	2809
ogygian	2809
here	2809
dwells	2809
the	2809
cunning	2810
and	2810
powerful	2810
goddess	2810
calypso	2810
daughter	2810
of	2810
atlas	2810
she	2810
lives	2810
by	2811
herself	2811
far	2811
from	2811
all	2811
neighbours	2811
human	2811
or	2811
divine	2811
fortune	2811
however	2811
me	2812
to	2812
her	2812
hearth	2812
all	2812
desolate	2812
and	2812
alone	2812
for	2812
jove	2812
struck	2812
my	2812
ship	2812
with	2812
his	2813
thunderbolts	2813
and	2813
broke	2813
it	2813
up	2813
in	2813
mid-ocean	2813
my	2813
brave	2813
comrades	2813
were	2814
drowned	2814
every	2814
man	2814
of	2814
them	2814
but	2814
i	2814
stuck	2814
to	2814
the	2814
keel	2814
and	2814
was	2814
carried	2814
hither	2815
and	2815
thither	2815
for	2815
the	2815
space	2815
of	2815
nine	2815
days	2815
till	2815
at	2815
last	2815
during	2815
the	2816
darkness	2816
of	2816
the	2816
tenth	2816
night	2816
the	2816
gods	2816
brought	2816
me	2816
to	2816
the	2816
ogygian	2816
island	2817
where	2817
the	2817
great	2817
goddess	2817
calypso	2817
lives	2817
she	2817
took	2817
me	2817
in	2817
and	2817
treated	2817
me	2818
with	2818
the	2818
utmost	2818
kindness	2818
indeed	2818
she	2818
wanted	2818
to	2818
make	2818
me	2818
immortal	2818
that	2819
i	2819
might	2819
never	2819
grow	2819
old	2819
but	2819
she	2819
could	2819
not	2819
persuade	2819
me	2819
to	2819
let	2819
her	2820
do	2820
so	2820
i	2822
stayed	2822
with	2822
calypso	2822
seven	2822
years	2822
straight	2822
on	2822
end	2822
and	2822
watered	2822
the	2822
good	2823
clothes	2823
she	2823
gave	2823
me	2823
with	2823
my	2823
tears	2823
during	2823
the	2823
whole	2823
time	2823
but	2823
at	2824
last	2824
when	2824
the	2824
eighth	2824
year	2824
came	2824
round	2824
she	2824
bade	2824
me	2824
depart	2824
of	2824
her	2824
own	2825
free	2825
will	2825
either	2825
because	2825
jove	2825
had	2825
told	2825
her	2825
she	2825
must	2825
or	2825
because	2825
she	2826
had	2826
changed	2826
her	2826
mind	2826
she	2826
sent	2826
me	2826
from	2826
her	2826
island	2826
on	2826
a	2826
raft	2826
which	2826
she	2827
provisioned	2827
with	2827
abundance	2827
of	2827
bread	2827
and	2827
wine	2827
moreover	2827
she	2827
gave	2827
me	2828
good	2828
stout	2828
clothing	2828
and	2828
sent	2828
me	2828
a	2828
wind	2828
that	2828
blew	2828
both	2828
warm	2828
and	2828
fair	2829
days	2829
seven	2829
and	2829
ten	2829
did	2829
i	2829
sail	2829
over	2829
the	2829
sea	2829
and	2829
on	2829
the	2829
eighteenth	2829
i	2830
caught	2830
sight	2830
of	2830
the	2830
first	2830
outlines	2830
of	2830
the	2830
mountains	2830
upon	2830
your	2830
coast	2830
and	2831
glad	2831
indeed	2831
was	2831
i	2831
to	2831
set	2831
eyes	2831
upon	2831
them	2831
nevertheless	2831
there	2831
was	2831
still	2832
much	2832
trouble	2832
in	2832
store	2832
for	2832
me	2832
for	2832
at	2832
this	2832
point	2832
neptune	2832
would	2832
let	2833
me	2833
go	2833
no	2833
further	2833
and	2833
raised	2833
a	2833
great	2833
storm	2833
against	2833
me	2833
the	2833
sea	2833
was	2834
so	2834
terribly	2834
high	2834
that	2834
i	2834
could	2834
no	2834
longer	2834
keep	2834
to	2834
my	2834
raft	2834
which	2834
went	2835
to	2835
pieces	2835
under	2835
the	2835
fury	2835
of	2835
the	2835
gale	2835
and	2835
i	2835
had	2835
to	2835
swim	2835
for	2835
it	2835
till	2836
wind	2836
and	2836
current	2836
brought	2836
me	2836
to	2836
your	2836
shores	2836
there	2838
i	2838
tried	2838
to	2838
land	2838
but	2838
could	2838
not	2838
for	2838
it	2838
was	2838
a	2838
bad	2838
place	2838
and	2838
the	2839
waves	2839
dashed	2839
me	2839
against	2839
the	2839
rocks	2839
so	2839
i	2839
again	2839
took	2839
to	2839
the	2839
sea	2839
and	2840
swam	2840
on	2840
till	2840
i	2840
came	2840
to	2840
a	2840
river	2840
that	2840
seemed	2840
the	2840
most	2840
likely	2840
landing	2840
place	2841
for	2841
there	2841
were	2841
no	2841
rocks	2841
and	2841
it	2841
was	2841
sheltered	2841
from	2841
the	2841
wind	2841
here	2842
then	2842
i	2842
got	2842
out	2842
of	2842
the	2842
water	2842
and	2842
gathered	2842
my	2842
senses	2842
together	2842
again	2843
night	2843
was	2843
coming	2843
on	2843
so	2843
i	2843
left	2843
the	2843
river	2843
and	2843
went	2843
into	2843
a	2843
thicket	2843
where	2844
i	2844
covered	2844
myself	2844
all	2844
over	2844
with	2844
leaves	2844
and	2844
presently	2844
heaven	2844
sent	2845
me	2845
off	2845
into	2845
a	2845
very	2845
deep	2845
sleep	2845
sick	2845
and	2845
sorry	2845
as	2845
i	2845
was	2845
i	2845
slept	2845
among	2846
the	2846
leaves	2846
all	2846
night	2846
and	2846
through	2846
the	2846
next	2846
day	2846
till	2846
afternoon	2846
when	2847
i	2847
woke	2847
as	2847
the	2847
sun	2847
was	2847
westering	2847
and	2847
saw	2847
your	2847
daughter's	2847
maid	2847
servants	2848
playing	2848
upon	2848
the	2848
beach	2848
and	2848
your	2848
daughter	2848
among	2848
them	2848
looking	2848
like	2849
a	2849
goddess	2849
i	2849
besought	2849
her	2849
aid	2849
and	2849
she	2849
proved	2849
to	2849
be	2849
of	2849
an	2849
excellent	2849
disposition	2850
much	2850
more	2850
so	2850
than	2850
could	2850
be	2850
expected	2850
from	2850
so	2850
young	2850
a	2850
person	2850
for	2851
young	2851
people	2851
are	2851
apt	2851
to	2851
be	2851
thoughtless	2851
she	2851
gave	2851
me	2851
plenty	2851
of	2851
bread	2852
and	2852
wine	2852
and	2852
when	2852
she	2852
had	2852
had	2852
me	2852
washed	2852
in	2852
the	2852
river	2852
she	2852
also	2852
gave	2853
me	2853
the	2853
clothes	2853
in	2853
which	2853
you	2853
see	2853
me	2853
now	2853
therefore	2853
though	2853
it	2853
has	2854
pained	2854
me	2854
to	2854
do	2854
so	2854
i	2854
have	2854
told	2854
you	2854
the	2854
whole	2854
truth	2854
then	2856
alcinous	2856
said	2856
stranger	2856
it	2856
was	2856
very	2856
wrong	2856
of	2856
my	2856
daughter	2856
not	2856
to	2857
bring	2857
you	2857
on	2857
at	2857
once	2857
to	2857
my	2857
house	2857
along	2857
with	2857
the	2857
maids	2857
seeing	2857
that	2857
she	2858
was	2858
the	2858
first	2858
person	2858
whose	2858
aid	2858
you	2858
asked	2858
pray	2860

not	2860
scold	2860
her	2860
replied	2860
ulysses	2860
she	2860
is	2860
not	2860
to	2860
blame	2860
she	2860
did	2861
tell	2861
me	2861
to	2861
follow	2861
along	2861
with	2861
the	2861
maids	2861
but	2861
i	2861
was	2861
ashamed	2861
and	2861
afraid	2862
for	2862
i	2862
thought	2862
you	2862
might	2862
perhaps	2862
be	2862
displeased	2862
if	2862
you	2862
saw	2862
me	2862
every	2863
human	2863
being	2863

sometimes	2863
a	2863
little	2863
suspicious	2863
and	2863
irritable	2863
stranger	2865
replied	2865
alcinous	2865
i	2865

of	2865
man	2865
to	2865
get	2865
angry	2865
about	2866
nothing	2866
it	2866
is	2866
always	2866
better	2866
to	2866
be	2866
reasonable	2866
but	2866
by	2866
father	2866
jove	2867
minerva	2867

a	2945
little	2945
way	2945
out	2945
from	2945

house	2946
of	2946

the	2946

with	2947
crowds	2947
of	2947

in	2947
great	2947
multitudes	2947

so	2949
as	2949
to	2949
provide	2949
a	2949
magnificent	2949
banquet	2950
a	2952
servant	2952
presently	2952
led	2952
in	2952
the	2952
famous	2952
bard	2952
demodocus	2952
whom	2952
the	2952
muse	2952
had	2953
dearly	2953
loved	2953
but	2953
to	2953
whom	2953
she	2953
had	2953
given	2953
both	2953
good	2953
and	2953
evil	2953
for	2953
though	2954
she	2954
had	2954
endowed	2954
him	2954
with	2954
a	2954
divine	2954
gift	2954
of	2954
song	2954
she	2954
had	2954
robbed	2954
him	2955
of	2955
his	2955
eyesight	2955
pontonous	2955
set	2955
a	2955
seat	2955
for	2955
him	2955
among	2955
the	2955
guests	2955
leaning	2956
it	2956
up	2956
against	2956
a	2956
bearing-post	2956
he	2956
hung	2956
the	2956
lyre	2956
for	2956
him	2956
on	2956
a	2957
peg	2957
over	2957
his	2957
head	2957
and	2957
showed	2957
him	2957
where	2957
he	2957
was	2957
to	2957
feel	2957
for	2957
it	2957
with	2957
his	2958
hands	2958
he	2958
also	2958
set	2958
a	2958
fair	2958
table	2958
with	2958
a	2958
basket	2958
of	2958
victuals	2958
by	2958
his	2958
side	2959
and	2959
a	2959
cup	2959
of	2959
wine	2959
from	2959
which	2959
he	2959
might	2959
drink	2959
whenever	2959
he	2959
was	2959
so	2960
disposed	2960
the	2962
company	2962
then	2962
laid	2962
their	2962
hands	2962
upon	2962
the	2962
good	2962
things	2962
that	2962
were	2962
before	2962
them	2963
but	2963
as	2963
soon	2963
as	2963
they	2963
had	2963
had	2963
enough	2963
to	2963
eat	2963
and	2963
drink	2963
the	2963
muse	2963
inspired	2964
demodocus	2964
to	2964
sing	2964
the	2964
feats	2964
of	2964
heroes	2964
and	2964
more	2964
especially	2964
a	2965
matter	2965
that	2965
was	2965
then	2965
in	2965
the	2965
mouths	2965
of	2965
all	2965
men	2965
to	2965
wit	2965
the	2965
quarrel	2965
between	2966
ulysses	2966
and	2966
achilles	2966
and	2966
the	2966
fierce	2966
words	2966
that	2966
they	2966
heaped	2966
on	2967
one	2967
another	2967
as	2967
they	2967
gat	2967
together	2967
at	2967
a	2967
banquet	2967
but	2967
agamemnon	2967
was	2967
glad	2968
when	2968
he	2968
heard	2968
his	2968
chieftains	2968
quarrelling	2968
with	2968
one	2968
another	2968
for	2968
apollo	2969
had	2969
foretold	2969
him	2969
this	2969
at	2969
pytho	2969
when	2969
he	2969
crossed	2969
the	2969
stone	2969
floor	2969
to	2970
consult	2970
the	2970
oracle	2970
here	2970
was	2970
the	2970
beginning	2970
of	2970
the	2970
evil	2970
that	2970
by	2970
the	2971
will	2971
of	2971
jove	2971
fell	2971
both	2971
danaans	2971
and	2971
trojans	2971
thus	2973
sang	2973
the	2973
bard	2973
but	2973
ulysses	2973
drew	2973
his	2973
purple	2973
mantle	2973
over	2973
his	2973
head	2973
and	2974
covered	2974
his	2974
face	2974
for	2974
he	2974
was	2974
ashamed	2974
to	2974
let	2974
the	2974
phaeacians	2974
see	2974
that	2975
he	2975
was	2975
weeping	2975
when	2975
the	2975
bard	2975
left	2975
off	2975
singing	2975
he	2975
wiped	2975
the	2975
tears	2975
from	2976
his	2976
eyes	2976
uncovered	2976
his	2976
face	2976
and	2976
taking	2976
his	2976
cup	2976
made	2976
a	2976
drink-offering	2976
to	2977
the	2977
gods	2977
but	2977
when	2977
the	2977
phaeacians	2977
pressed	2977
demodocus	2977
to	2977
sing	2977
further	2977
for	2978
they	2978
delighted	2978
in	2978
his	2978
lays	2978
then	2978
ulysses	2978
again	2978
drew	2978
his	2978
mantle	2978
over	2979
his	2979
head	2979
and	2979
wept	2979
bitterly	2979
no	2979
one	2979
noticed	2979
his	2979
distress	2979
except	2979
alcinous	2980
who	2980
was	2980
sitting	2980
near	2980
him	2980
and	2980
heard	2980
the	2980
heavy	2980
sighs	2980
that	2980
he	2981
was	2981
heaving	2981
so	2981
he	2981
at	2981
once	2981
said	2981
aldermen	2981
and	2981
town	2981
councillors	2981
of	2982
the	2982
phaeacians	2982
we	2982
have	2982
had	2982
enough	2982
now	2982
both	2982
of	2982
the	2982
feast	2982
and	2982
of	2983
the	2983
minstrelsy	2983
that	2983
is	2983
its	2983
due	2983
accompaniment	2983
let	2983
us	2983
proceed	2983
therefore	2983
to	2984
the	2984
athletic	2984
sports	2984
so	2984
that	2984
our	2984
guest	2984
on	2984
his	2984
return	2984
home	2984
may	2984
be	2984
able	2985
to	2985
tell	2985
his	2985
friends	2985
how	2985
much	2985
we	2985
surpass	2985
all	2985
other	2985
nations	2985
as	2985
boxers	2986
wrestlers	2986
jumpers	2986
and	2986
runners	2986
with	2988
these	2988
words	2988
he	2988
led	2988
the	2988
way	2988
and	2988
the	2988
others	2988
followed	2988
after	2988
a	2988
servant	2989
hung	2989
demodocus's	2989
lyre	2989
on	2989
its	2989
peg	2989
for	2989
him	2989
led	2989
him	2989
out	2989
of	2989
the	2989
cloister	2990
and	2990
set	2990
him	2990
on	2990
the	2990
same	2990
way	2990
as	2990
that	2990
along	2990
which	2990
all	2990
the	2990
chief	2991
men	2991
of	2991
the	2991
phaeacians	2991
were	2991
going	2991
to	2991
see	2991
the	2991
sports	2991
a	2991
crowd	2991
of	2992
several	2992
thousands	2992
of	2992
people	2992
followed	2992
them	2992
and	2992
there	2992
were	2992
many	2992
excellent	2993
competitors	2993
for	2993
all	2993
the	2993
prizes	2993

amphialus	2995
son	2995
of	2995
polyneus	2995
son	2995
of	2995
tecton	2995
there	2995
was	2995
also	2995
euryalus	2995
son	2996
of	2996
naubolus	2996
who	2996
was	2996
like	2996
mars	2996
himself	2996
and	2996
was	2996
the	2996
best	2996
looking	2996
man	2997
among	2997
the	2997
phaecians	2997
except	2997
laodamas	2997
three	2997
sons	2997
of	2997
alcinous	2997
laodamas	2997
halios	2998
and	2998
clytoneus	2998
competed	2998
also	2998
the	3000
foot	3000
races	3000
came	3000
first	3000
the	3000
course	3000
was	3000
set	3000
out	3000
for	3000
them	3000
from	3000
the	3000
starting	3001
post	3001
and	3001
they	3001
raised	3001
a	3001
dust	3001
upon	3001
the	3001
plain	3001
as	3001
they	3001
all	3001
flew	3001
forward	3002
at	3002
the	3002
same	3002
moment	3002
clytoneus	3002
came	3002
in	3002
first	3002
by	3002
a	3002
long	3002
way	3002
he	3003
left	3003
every	3003
one	3003
else	3003
behind	3003
him	3003
by	3003
the	3003
length	3003
of	3003
the	3003
furrow	3003
that	3003
a	3004
couple	3004
of	3004
mules	3004
can	3004
plough	3004
in	3004
a	3004
fallow	3004
field	3004
they	3004
then	3004
turned	3004
to	3004
the	3005
painful	3005
art	3005
of	3005
wrestling	3005
and	3005
here	3005
euryalus	3005
proved	3005
to	3005
be	3005
the	3005
best	3005
man	3006
amphialus	3006
excelled	3006
all	3006
the	3006
others	3006
in	3006
jumping	3006
while	3006
at	3006
throwing	3006
the	3007
disc	3007
there	3007
was	3007
no	3007
one	3007
who	3007
could	3007
approach	3007
elatreus	3007
alcinous's	3007
son	3008
laodamas	3008
was	3008
the	3008
best	3008
boxer	3008
and	3008
he	3008
it	3008
was	3008
who	3008
presently	3008
said	3008
when	3009
they	3009
had	3009
all	3009
been	3009
diverted	3009
with	3009
the	3009
games	3009
let	3009
us	3009
ask	3009
the	3009
stranger	3009
whether	3010
he	3010
excels	3010
in	3010
any	3010
of	3010
these	3010
sports	3010
he	3010
seems	3010
very	3010
powerfully	3010
built	3011
his	3011
thighs	3011
claves	3011
hands	3011
and	3011
neck	3011
are	3011
of	3011
prodigious	3011
strength	3011
nor	3012
is	3012
he	3012
at	3012
all	3012
old	3012
but	3012
he	3012
has	3012
suffered	3012
much	3012
lately	3012
and	3012
there	3012
is	3012
nothing	3013
like	3013
the	3013
sea	3013
for	3013
making	3013
havoc	3013
with	3013
a	3013
man	3013
no	3013
matter	3013
how	3013
strong	3013
he	3014
is	3014
you	3016
are	3016
quite	3016
right	3016
laodamas	3016
replied	3016
euryalus	3016
go	3016
up	3016
to	3016
your	3016
guest	3017
and	3017
speak	3017
to	3017
him	3017
about	3017
it	3017
yourself	3017
when	3019
laodamas	3019
heard	3019
this	3019
he	3019
made	3019
his	3019
way	3019
into	3019
the	3019
middle	3019

the	3027

answered	3029
laodamas	3029
why	3029
do	3029
you	3029
taunt	3029
me	3029
in	3029
this	3029
way	3029
my	3029
mind	3029
is	3030
set	3030
rather	3030
on	3030
cares	3030
than	3030
contests	3030
i	3030
have	3030
been	3030
through	3030
infinite	3030
trouble	3031
and	3031
am	3031
come	3031
among	3031
you	3031

euryalus	3034
reviled	3034
him	3034
outright	3034
and	3034
said	3034
i	3034
gather	3034
then	3034
that	3034
you	3035
are	3035
unskilled	3035
in	3035
any	3035
of	3035
the	3035
many	3035
sports	3035
that	3035
men	3035
generally	3035
delight	3035
in	3036

suppose	3036
you	3036
are	3036
one	3036
of	3036
those	3036
grasping	3036
traders	3036
that	3036
go	3036
about	3036
in	3037
ships	3037
as	3037
captains	3037
or	3037
merchants	3037
and	3037
who	3037
think	3037
of	3037
nothing	3037

of	3037
their	3038
outward	3038
freights	3038

homeward	3038

there	3038

not	3038

the	3039

about	3039
you	3039
for	3041
shame	3041
sir	3041
answered	3041
ulysses	3041
fiercely	3041
you	3041
are	3041
an	3041
insolent	3041
fellow	3042
so	3042
true	3042
is	3042
it	3042
that	3042
the	3042
gods	3042
do	3042
not	3042
grace	3042
all	3042
men	3042
alike	3042
in	3042
speech	3043
person	3043
and	3043
understanding	3043
one	3043
man	3043
may	3043
be	3043
of	3043
weak	3043
presence	3043
but	3044
heaven	3044
has	3044
adorned	3044
this	3044
with	3044
such	3044
a	3044
good	3044
conversation	3044
that	3044
he	3044
charms	3045
every	3045
one	3045
who	3045
sees	3045
him	3045
his	3045
honeyed	3045
moderation	3045
carries	3045
his	3045
hearers	3046
with	3046
him	3046
so	3046
that	3046
he	3046
is	3046
leader	3046
in	3046
all	3046
assemblies	3046
of	3046
his	3046
fellows	3046
and	3047
wherever	3047
he	3047
goes	3047
he	3047
is	3047
looked	3047
up	3047
to	3047
another	3047
may	3047
be	3047
as	3047
handsome	3047
as	3048
a	3048
god	3048
but	3048
his	3048
good	3048
looks	3048
are	3048
not	3048
crowned	3048
with	3048
discretion	3048
this	3048
is	3049
your	3049
case	3049
no	3049
god	3049
could	3049
make	3049
a	3049
finer	3049
looking	3049
fellow	3049
than	3049
you	3049
are	3049
but	3050
you	3050
are	3050
a	3050
fool	3050
your	3050
ill-judged	3050
remarks	3050
have	3050
made	3050
me	3050
exceedingly	3050
angry	3051
and	3051
you	3051
are	3051
quite	3051
mistaken	3051
for	3051
i	3051
excel	3051
in	3051
a	3051
great	3051
many	3051
athletic	3051
exercises	3052
indeed	3052
so	3052
long	3052
as	3052
i	3052
had	3052
youth	3052
and	3052
strength	3052
i	3052
was	3052
among	3052
the	3053
first	3053
athletes	3053
of	3053
the	3053
age	3053
now	3053
however	3053
i	3053
am	3053
worn	3053
out	3053
by	3053
labour	3053
and	3054
sorrow	3054
for	3054
i	3054
have	3054
gone	3054
through	3054
much	3054
both	3054
on	3054
the	3054
field	3054
of	3054
battle	3054
and	3055
by	3055
the	3055
waves	3055
of	3055
the	3055
weary	3055
sea	3055
still	3055
in	3055
spite	3055
of	3055
all	3055
this	3055
i	3055
will	3055
compete	3056
for	3056
your	3056
taunts	3056
have	3056
stung	3056
me	3056
to	3056
the	3056
quick	3056
so	3058
he	3058
hurried	3058
up	3058
without	3058
even	3058
taking	3058
his	3058
cloak	3058
off	3058
and	3058
seized	3058
a	3058
disc	3058
larger	3059
more	3059
massive	3059
and	3059
much	3059
heavier	3059
than	3059
those	3059
used	3059
by	3059
the	3059
phaeacians	3059
when	3060
disc-throwing	3060
among	3060
themselves	3060
then	3060
swinging	3060
it	3060
back	3060
he	3060
threw	3060
it	3061
from	3061
his	3061
brawny	3061
hand	3061
and	3061
it	3061
made	3061
a	3061
humming	3061
sound	3061
in	3061
the	3061
air	3061
as	3061
he	3062
did	3062
so	3062
the	3062
phaeacians	3062
quailed	3062
beneath	3062
the	3062
rushing	3062
of	3062
its	3062
flight	3062
as	3063
it	3063
sped	3063
gracefully	3063
from	3063
his	3063
hand	3063
and	3063
flew	3063
beyond	3063
any	3063
mark	3063
that	3063
had	3064
been	3064
made	3064
yet	3064
minerva	3064
in	3064
the	3064
form	3064
of	3064
a	3064
man	3064
came	3064
and	3064
marked	3064
the	3065
place	3065
where	3065
it	3065
had	3065
fallen	3065
a	3065
blind	3065
man	3065
sir	3065
said	3065
she	3065
could	3065
easily	3066
tell	3066
your	3066
mark	3066
by	3066
groping	3066
for	3066
it	3066
it	3066
is	3066
so	3066
far	3066
ahead	3066
of	3066
any	3066
other	3067
you	3067
may	3067
make	3067
your	3067
mind	3067
easy	3067
about	3067
this	3067
contest	3067
for	3067
no	3067
phaeacian	3067
can	3068
come	3068
near	3068
to	3068
such	3068
a	3068
throw	3068
as	3068
yours	3068
ulysses	3070
was	3070
glad	3070
when	3070
he	3070
found	3070
he	3070
had	3070
a	3070
friend	3070
among	3070
the	3070
lookers-on	3070
so	3071
he	3071
began	3071
to	3071
speak	3071
more	3071
pleasantly	3071
young	3071
men	3071
said	3071
he	3071
come	3071
up	3072
to	3072
that	3072
throw	3072
if	3072
you	3072
can	3072
and	3072
i	3072
will	3072
throw	3072
another	3072
disc	3072
as	3072
heavy	3072
or	3073
even	3073
heavier	3073
if	3073
anyone	3073
wants	3073
to	3073
have	3073
a	3073
bout	3073
with	3073
me	3073
let	3073
him	3073
come	3073
on	3074
for	3074
i	3074
am	3074
exceedingly	3074
angry	3074
i	3074
will	3074
box	3074
wrestle	3074
or	3074
run	3074
i	3074
do	3074
not	3075
care	3075
what	3075
it	3075
is	3075
with	3075
any	3075
man	3075
of	3075
you	3075
all	3075
except	3075
laodamas	3075
but	3075
not	3076
with	3076
him	3076
because	3076
i	3076
am	3076
his	3076
guest	3076
and	3076
one	3076
cannot	3076
compete	3076
with	3076
one's	3076
own	3077
personal	3077
friend	3077
at	3077
least	3077
i	3077
do	3077
not	3077
think	3077
it	3077
a	3077
prudent	3077
or	3077
a	3077
sensible	3077
thing	3078
for	3078
a	3078

to	3078
challenge	3078
his	3078
host's	3078
family	3078
at	3078
any	3078
game	3078

when	3079
he	3079
is	3079
in	3079
a	3079
foreign	3079

under	3079
his	3080
own	3080
feet	3080

the	3081
matter	3081
out	3081
and	3081

an	3083
excellent	3083
archer	3083

down	3084
with	3084

the	3085
only	3085
man	3085
who	3085
could	3085
shoot	3086
better	3086
than	3086
i	3086
could	3086
when	3086
we	3086
achaeans	3086
were	3086
before	3086
troy	3086
and	3086
in	3086
practice	3087
i	3087
far	3087
excel	3087
every	3087
one	3087
else	3087
in	3087
the	3087
whole	3087

upon	3088
the	3088

i	3088
should	3088
not	3088
like	3088
to	3089
shoot	3089
against	3089
the	3089
mighty	3089
dead	3089
such	3089
as	3089
hercules	3089

eurytus	3089

cechalian-men	3090

against	3090
the	3090
gods	3090

this	3090
in	3090
fact	3091

prematurely	3091

end	3091
for	3091
apollo	3091
was	3091
angry	3091
with	3092
him	3092

killed	3092
him	3092

he	3092
challenged	3092

i	3094
am	3094
afraid	3094

of	3094

all	3099
that	3099
you	3099

told	3099
us	3099
from	3099

i	3100
understand	3100
that	3100
you	3100
are	3100
willing	3100
to	3100
show	3100
your	3100
prowess	3100
as	3100
having	3100
been	3101
displeased	3101
with	3101
some	3101

to	3101
you	3102

your	3105

for	3106
accomplishments	3106
of	3106
all	3106
kinds	3106
we	3106
are	3106
not	3107
particularly	3107
remarkable	3107
for	3107
our	3107
boxing	3107
nor	3107
yet	3107
as	3107

please	3110
some	3111
of	3111
you	3111
who	3111
are	3111
the	3111
best	3111

may	3112
be	3112
able	3112
to	3112
tell	3112
his	3112

how	3112
much	3112

as	3113
sailors	3113
runners	3113
dancers	3113
minstrels	3113
demodocus	3113
has	3114
left	3114
his	3114
lyre	3114
at	3114
my	3114
house	3114
so	3114
run	3114
some	3114
one	3114
or	3114

it	3115
for	3115
him	3115
on	3117
this	3117
a	3117
servant	3117
hurried	3117
off	3117
to	3117
bring	3117
the	3117
lyre	3117
from	3117
the	3117
king's	3117
house	3117
and	3118
the	3118
nine	3118
men	3118
who	3118
had	3118
been	3118
chosen	3118
as	3118
stewards	3118
stood	3118
forward	3118
it	3118
was	3119
their	3119
business	3119
to	3119
manage	3119
everything	3119
connected	3119
with	3119
the	3119
sports	3119
so	3120
they	3120
made	3120
the	3120
ground	3120
smooth	3120
and	3120
marked	3120
a	3120
wide	3120
space	3120
for	3120
the	3120
dancers	3120
presently	3121
the	3121
servant	3121
came	3121
back	3121
with	3121
demodocus's	3121
lyre	3121
and	3121
he	3121
took	3121
his	3122
place	3122
in	3122
the	3122
midst	3122
of	3122
them	3122
whereon	3122
the	3122
best	3122
young	3122
dancers	3122
in	3122
the	3123
town	3123
began	3123
to	3123
foot	3123
and	3123
trip	3123
it	3123
so	3123
nimbly	3123
that	3123
ulysses	3123
was	3123
delighted	3123
with	3124
the	3124
merry	3124
twinkling	3124
of	3124
their	3124
feet	3124
meanwhile	3126
the	3126
bard	3126
began	3126
to	3126
sing	3126
the	3126
loves	3126
of	3126
mars	3126
and	3126
venus	3126
and	3126
how	3127
they	3127
first	3127
began	3127
their	3127
intrigue	3127
in	3127
the	3127
house	3127
of	3127
vulcan	3127
mars	3127
made	3127
venus	3128
many	3128
presents	3128
and	3128
defiled	3128
king	3128
vulcan's	3128
marriage	3128
bed	3128
so	3128
the	3128
sun	3129
who	3129
saw	3129
what	3129
they	3129
were	3129
about	3129
told	3129
vulcan	3129
vulcan	3129
was	3129
very	3129
angry	3129
when	3130
he	3130
heard	3130
such	3130
dreadful	3130
news	3130
so	3130
he	3130
went	3130
to	3130
his	3130
smithy	3130
brooding	3130
mischief	3131
got	3131
his	3131
great	3131
anvil	3131
into	3131
its	3131
place	3131
and	3131
began	3131
to	3131
forge	3131
some	3131
chains	3132
which	3132
none	3132
could	3132
either	3132
unloose	3132
or	3132
break	3132
so	3132
that	3132
they	3132
might	3132
stay	3133
there	3133
in	3133
that	3133
place	3133
when	3133
he	3133
had	3133
finished	3133
his	3133
snare	3133
he	3133
went	3133
into	3133
his	3134
bedroom	3134
and	3134
festooned	3134
the	3134
bed-posts	3134
all	3134
over	3134
with	3134
chains	3134
like	3134
cobwebs	3135
he	3135
also	3135
let	3135
many	3135
hang	3135
down	3135
from	3135
the	3135
great	3135
beam	3135
of	3135
the	3135
ceiling	3135
not	3136
even	3136
a	3136
god	3136
could	3136
see	3136
them	3136
so	3136
fine	3136
and	3136
subtle	3136
were	3136
they	3136
as	3136
soon	3136
as	3137
he	3137
had	3137
spread	3137
the	3137
chains	3137
all	3137
over	3137
the	3137
bed	3137
he	3137
made	3137
as	3137
though	3137
he	3137
were	3138
setting	3138
out	3138
for	3138
the	3138
fair	3138
state	3138
of	3138
lemnos	3138
which	3138
of	3138
all	3138
places	3138
in	3139
the	3139
world	3139
was	3139
the	3139
one	3139
he	3139
was	3139
most	3139
fond	3139
of	3139
but	3139
mars	3139
kept	3139
no	3139
blind	3139
look	3140
out	3140
and	3140
as	3140
soon	3140
as	3140
he	3140
saw	3140
him	3140
start	3140
hurried	3140
off	3140
to	3140
his	3140
house	3140
burning	3141
with	3141
love	3141
for	3141
venus	3141
now	3143
venus	3143
was	3143
just	3143
come	3143
in	3143
from	3143
a	3143
visit	3143
to	3143
her	3143
father	3143
jove	3143
and	3143
was	3143
about	3144
sitting	3144
down	3144
when	3144
mars	3144
came	3144
inside	3144
the	3144
house	3144
an	3144
said	3144
as	3144
he	3144
took	3145
her	3145
hand	3145
in	3145
his	3145
own	3145
let	3145
us	3145
go	3145
to	3145
the	3145
couch	3145
of	3145
vulcan	3145
he	3145
is	3145
not	3146
at	3146
home	3146
but	3146
is	3146
gone	3146
off	3146
to	3146
lemnos	3146
among	3146
the	3146
sintians	3146
whose	3146
speech	3146
is	3147
barbarous	3147
she	3149
was	3149
nothing	3149
loth	3149
so	3149
they	3149
went	3149
to	3149
the	3149
couch	3149
to	3149
take	3149
their	3149
rest	3149
whereon	3150
they	3150
were	3150
caught	3150
in	3150
the	3150
toils	3150
which	3150
cunning	3150
vulcan	3150
had	3150
spread	3150
for	3151
them	3151
and	3151
could	3151
neither	3151
get	3151
up	3151
nor	3151
stir	3151
hand	3151
or	3151
foot	3151
but	3151
found	3151
too	3152
late	3152
that	3152
they	3152
were	3152
in	3152
a	3152
trap	3152
then	3152
vulcan	3152
came	3152
up	3152
to	3152
them	3152
for	3152
he	3153
had	3153
turned	3153
back	3153
before	3153
reaching	3153
lemnos	3153
when	3153
his	3153
scout	3153
the	3153
sun	3153
told	3154
him	3154
what	3154
was	3154
going	3154
on	3154
he	3154
was	3154
in	3154
a	3154
furious	3154
passion	3154
and	3154
stood	3154
in	3155
the	3155
vestibule	3155
making	3155
a	3155
dreadful	3155
noise	3155
as	3155
he	3155
shouted	3155
to	3155
all	3155
the	3155
gods	3156
father	3158
jove	3158
he	3158
cried	3158
and	3158
all	3158
you	3158
other	3158
blessed	3158
gods	3158
who	3158
live	3158
for	3159
ever	3159
come	3159
here	3159
and	3159
see	3159
the	3159
ridiculous	3159
and	3159
disgraceful	3159
sight	3159
that	3159
i	3160
will	3160
show	3160
you	3160
jove's	3160
daughter	3160
venus	3160
is	3160
always	3160
dishonouring	3160
me	3160
because	3160
i	3161
am	3161
lame	3161
she	3161
is	3161
in	3161
love	3161
with	3161
mars	3161
who	3161
is	3161
handsome	3161
and	3161
clean	3161
built	3161
whereas	3162
i	3162
am	3162
a	3162
cripple	3162
but	3162
my	3162
parents	3162
are	3162
to	3162
blame	3162
for	3162
that	3162
not	3162
i	3163
they	3163
ought	3163
never	3163
to	3163
have	3163
begotten	3163
me	3163
come	3163
and	3163
see	3163
the	3163
pair	3163
together	3163
asleep	3164
on	3164
my	3164
bed	3164
it	3164
makes	3164
me	3164
furious	3164
to	3164
look	3164
at	3164
them	3164
they	3164
are	3164
very	3164
fond	3165
of	3165
one	3165
another	3165
but	3165
i	3165
do	3165
not	3165
think	3165
they	3165
will	3165
lie	3165
there	3165
longer	3165
than	3166
they	3166
can	3166
help	3166
nor	3166
do	3166
i	3166
think	3166
that	3166
they	3166
will	3166
sleep	3166
much	3166
there	3166
however	3167
they	3167
shall	3167
stay	3167
till	3167
her	3167
father	3167
has	3167
repaid	3167
me	3167
the	3167
sum	3167
i	3167
gave	3167
him	3168
for	3168
his	3168
baggage	3168
of	3168
a	3168
daughter	3168
who	3168
is	3168
fair	3168
but	3168
not	3168
honest	3168
on	3170
this	3170
the	3170
gods	3170
gathered	3170
to	3170
the	3170
house	3170
of	3170
vulcan	3170
earth-encircling	3170
neptune	3171
came	3171
and	3171
mercury	3171
the	3171
bringer	3171
of	3171
luck	3171
and	3171
king	3171
apollo	3171
but	3171
the	3172
goddesses	3172
stayed	3172
at	3172
home	3172
all	3172
of	3172
them	3172
for	3172
shame	3172
then	3172
the	3172
givers	3172
of	3173
all	3173
good	3173
things	3173
stood	3173
in	3173
the	3173
doorway	3173
and	3173
the	3173
blessed	3173
gods	3173
roared	3173
with	3174
inextinguishable	3174
laughter	3174
as	3174
they	3174
saw	3174
how	3174
cunning	3174
vulcan	3174
had	3174
been	3175
whereon	3175
one	3175
would	3175
turn	3175
towards	3175
his	3175
neighbour	3175
saying	3175
ill	3177
deeds	3177
do	3177
not	3177
prosper	3177
and	3177
the	3177
weak	3177
confound	3177
the	3177
strong	3177
see	3177
how	3177
limping	3178
vulcan	3178
lame	3178
as	3178
he	3178
is	3178
has	3178
caught	3178
mars	3178
who	3178
is	3178
the	3178
fleetest	3178
god	3179
in	3179
heaven	3179
and	3179
now	3179
mars	3179
will	3179
be	3179
cast	3179
in	3179
heavy	3179
damages	3179
thus	3181
did	3181
they	3181
converse	3181
but	3181
king	3181
apollo	3181
said	3181
to	3181
mercury	3181
messenger	3181
mercury	3182
giver	3182
of	3182
good	3182
things	3182
you	3182
would	3182
not	3182
care	3182
how	3182
strong	3182
the	3182
chains	3182
were	3183
would	3183
you	3183
if	3183
you	3183
could	3183
sleep	3183
with	3183
venus	3183
king	3185
apollo	3185
answered	3185
mercury	3185
i	3185
only	3185
wish	3185
i	3185
might	3185
get	3185
the	3185
chance	3185
though	3186
there	3186
were	3186
three	3186
times	3186
as	3186
many	3186
chains	3186
and	3186
you	3186
might	3186
look	3186
on	3186
all	3187
of	3187
you	3187
gods	3187
and	3187
goddesses	3187
but	3187
would	3187
sleep	3187
with	3187
her	3187
if	3187
i	3187
could	3187
the	3189
immortal	3189
gods	3189
burst	3189
out	3189
laughing	3189
as	3189
they	3189
heard	3189
him	3189
but	3189
neptune	3189
took	3190
it	3190
all	3190
seriously	3190
and	3190
kept	3190
on	3190
imploring	3190
vulcan	3190
to	3190
set	3190
mars	3190
free	3190
again	3191
let	3191
him	3191
go	3191
he	3191
cried	3191
and	3191
i	3191
will	3191
undertake	3191
as	3191
you	3191
require	3191
that	3192
he	3192

both	3210

the	3210

phaeacians	3210
were	3211
charmed	3211
as	3211
they	3211
heard	3211

no	3214
one	3214
to	3214

they	3214
took	3214
a	3214
red	3214
ball	3214
which	3214
polybus	3214
had	3215

bent	3215
himself	3215
backwards	3215
and	3215
threw	3215

up	3216
towards	3216

and	3217
caught	3217
it	3217
with	3217
ease	3217
before	3217
it	3217
came	3217
down	3217
again	3217
when	3217

done	3217
throwing	3218
the	3218
ball	3218

and	3218
at	3219
the	3219
same	3219
time	3219
kept	3219
on	3219
throwing	3219
it	3219
backwards	3219
and	3219
forwards	3219
to	3219
one	3219
another	3220

set	3330
fire	3330
to	3330
their	3330
tents	3330

sailed	3330
away	3330
while	3330
others	3330
hidden	3331
within	3331
the	3331
horse	3331
were	3331
waiting	3331
with	3331
ulysses	3331
in	3331
the	3331
trojan	3331
place	3331
of	3332
assembly	3332
for	3332
the	3332

drawn	3332
the	3332

round	3333
it	3333

breaking	3334
it	3335
up	3335
then	3335
and	3335
there	3335
others	3335
would	3335
have	3335
it	3335
dragged	3335
to	3335
the	3335
top	3335
of	3335
the	3335
rock	3336
on	3336
which	3336
the	3336

stood	3336
and	3336
then	3336
thrown	3336
down	3336
the	3336
precipice	3336
while	3337
yet	3337
others	3337
were	3337
for	3337
letting	3337
it	3337
remain	3337
as	3337
an	3337
offering	3337
and	3337
propitiation	3337
for	3338
the	3338
gods	3338
and	3338
this	3338
was	3338
how	3338
they	3338
settled	3338
it	3338
in	3338
the	3338
end	3338
for	3338
the	3338
city	3339
was	3339
doomed	3339
when	3339
it	3339
took	3339
in	3339
that	3339
horse	3339
within	3339
which	3339
were	3339
all	3339
the	3340
bravest	3340
of	3340
the	3340
argives	3340
waiting	3340
to	3340
bring	3340
death	3340
and	3340
destruction	3340
on	3341
the	3341
trojans	3341
anon	3341
he	3341
sang	3341
how	3341
the	3341
sons	3341
of	3341
the	3341
achaeans	3341
issued	3341
from	3341
the	3342
horse	3342
and	3342
sacked	3342
the	3342
town	3342
breaking	3342
out	3342
from	3342
their	3342
ambuscade	3342
he	3343
sang	3343
how	3343
they	3343
over	3343
ran	3343
the	3343
city	3343
hither	3343
and	3343
thither	3343
and	3343
ravaged	3343
it	3344
and	3344
how	3344
ulysses	3344
went	3344
raging	3344
like	3344
mars	3344
along	3344
with	3344
menelaus	3344
to	3344
the	3344
house	3345
of	3345
deiphobus	3345
it	3345
was	3345
there	3345
that	3345
the	3345
fight	3345
raged	3345
most	3345
furiously	3345
nevertheless	3346
by	3346
minerva's	3346
help	3346
he	3346
was	3346
victorious	3346
all	3348
this	3348
he	3348
told	3348
but	3348
ulysses	3348
was	3348
overcome	3348
as	3348
he	3348
heard	3348
him	3348
and	3348
his	3348
cheeks	3349
were	3349
wet	3349
with	3349
tears	3349
he	3349
wept	3349
as	3349
a	3349
woman	3349
weeps	3349
when	3349
she	3349
throws	3349
herself	3350
on	3350
the	3350
body	3350
of	3350
her	3350
husband	3350
who	3350
has	3350
fallen	3350
before	3350
his	3350
own	3350
city	3350
and	3351
people	3351
fighting	3351
bravely	3351
in	3351
defence	3351
of	3351
his	3351
home	3351
and	3351
children	3351
she	3352
screams	3352
aloud	3352
and	3352
flings	3352
her	3352
arms	3352
about	3352
him	3352
as	3352
he	3352
lies	3352
gasping	3352
for	3353
breath	3353
and	3353
dying	3353
but	3353
her	3353
enemies	3353
beat	3353
her	3353
from	3353
behind	3353
about	3353
the	3353
back	3354
and	3354
shoulders	3354
and	3354
carry	3354
her	3354
off	3354
into	3354
slavery	3354
to	3354
a	3354
life	3354
of	3354
labour	3354
and	3355
sorrow	3355
and	3355
the	3355
beauty	3355
fades	3355
from	3355
her	3355
cheeks	3355
even	3355
so	3355
piteously	3355
did	3356
ulysses	3356
weep	3356
but	3356
none	3356
of	3356
those	3356
present	3356
perceived	3356
his	3356
tears	3356
except	3356
alcinous	3357
who	3357
was	3357
sitting	3357
near	3357
him	3357
and	3357
could	3357
hear	3357
the	3357
sobs	3357
and	3357
sighs	3357
that	3358
he	3358
was	3358
heaving	3358
the	3358
king	3358
therefore	3358
at	3358
once	3358
rose	3358
and	3358
said	3358
aldermen	3360
and	3360
town	3360
councillors	3360
of	3360
the	3360
phaeacians	3360
let	3360
demodocus	3360
cease	3360
his	3361
song	3361
for	3361
there	3361
are	3361
those	3361
present	3361
who	3361
do	3361
not	3361
seem	3361
to	3361
like	3361
it	3361
from	3362
the	3362
moment	3362
that	3362
we	3362
had	3362
done	3362
supper	3362
and	3362
demodocus	3362
began	3362
to	3362
sing	3362
our	3363
guest	3363
has	3363
been	3363
all	3363
the	3363
time	3363
groaning	3363
and	3363
lamenting	3363
he	3363
is	3363
evidently	3363
in	3364
great	3364
trouble	3364
so	3364
let	3364
the	3364
bard	3364
leave	3364
off	3364
that	3364
we	3364
may	3364
all	3364
enjoy	3364
ourselves	3365
hosts	3365
and	3365
guest	3365
alike	3365
this	3365
will	3365
be	3365
much	3365
more	3365
as	3365
it	3365
should	3365
be	3366
for	3366
all	3366
these	3366
festivities	3366
with	3366
the	3366
escort	3366
and	3366
the	3366
presents	3366
that	3366
we	3367
are	3367
making	3367
with	3367
so	3367
much	3367
good	3367
will	3367
are	3367
wholly	3367
in	3367
his	3367
honour	3367
and	3367
any	3368
one	3368

even	3368
a	3368
moderate	3368
amount	3368
of	3368
right	3368
feeling	3368

that	3368
he	3368
ought	3369
to	3369
treat	3369
a	3369
guest	3369
and	3369
a	3369
suppliant	3369
as	3369
though	3369
he	3369
were	3369
his	3369
own	3369
brother	3369
therefore	3371
sir	3371

you	3371
on	3371
your	3371
part	3371

no	3371

in	3372

about	3372
which	3372
i	3372
shall	3372
ask	3372
you	3372
it	3372

be	3372
more	3372
polite	3373
in	3373
you	3373
to	3373
give	3373
me	3373
a	3373
plain	3373

without	3376
any	3376

also	3378
your	3378
country	3378
nation	3378

is	3384
no	3385
danger	3385
of	3385
being	3385
wrecked	3385
or	3385
coming	3385
to	3385
any	3385
harm	3385
still	3385
i	3385
do	3385
remember	3385
hearing	3386
my	3386
father	3386
say	3386
that	3386
neptune	3386
was	3386
angry	3386
with	3386
us	3386
for	3386
being	3386
too	3386
easy-going	3387
in	3387
the	3387
matter	3387
of	3387
giving	3387
people	3387
escorts	3387
he	3387
said	3387
that	3387
one	3387
of	3388
these	3388
days	3388
he	3388
should	3388
wreck	3388
a	3388
ship	3388
of	3388
ours	3388
as	3388
it	3388
was	3388
returning	3388
from	3388
having	3389
escorted	3389
some	3389
one	3389
and	3389
bury	3389
our	3389
city	3389
under	3389
a	3389
high	3389
mountain	3389
this	3390
is	3390
what	3390
my	3390
used	3390
to	3390
say	3390
but	3390
whether	3390
the	3390
god	3390
will	3390
carry	3390
out	3390
his	3390
threat	3391
or	3391
no	3391
is	3391
a	3391
matter	3391
which	3391
he	3391
will	3391
decide	3391
for	3391
himself	3391
and	3393
now	3393
tell	3393
me	3393
and	3393
tell	3393
me	3393
true	3393
where	3393
have	3393
you	3393
been	3393
wandering	3393
and	3394
in	3394
what	3394
countries	3394
have	3394
you	3394
travelled	3394
tell	3394
us	3394
of	3394
the	3394
peoples	3394
themselves	3394
and	3395
of	3395
their	3395
cities	3395
who	3395
were	3395
hostile	3395
savage	3395
and	3395
uncivilized	3395
and	3395
who	3396
on	3396
the	3396
other	3396
hand	3396
hospitable	3396
and	3396
humane	3396
tell	3396
us	3396
also	3396
why	3396
you	3396
are	3397
made	3397
unhappy	3397
on	3397
hearing	3397
about	3397

the	3397
argive	3397

from	3398
troy	3398
the	3398

and	3398
sent	3398
them	3398
their	3398
misfortunes	3398
in	3399
order	3399
that	3399
future	3399
generations	3399
might	3399
have	3399
something	3399

is	3411
nothing	3411
better	3412

a	3412

merry	3412
together	3412
with	3413
the	3413

fills	3414
his	3414

for	3415
every	3415
man	3415
this	3415
is	3415
indeed	3415
as	3415
fair	3415
a	3415
sight	3415
as	3415
a	3415
man	3415
can	3415
see	3415
now	3416
however	3416
since	3416
you	3416
are	3416
inclined	3416
to	3416
ask	3416
the	3416
story	3416
of	3416
my	3416

and	3417
rekindle	3417
my	3417
own	3417
sad	3417

in	3417
respect	3417
of	3417
them	3417
i	3417
do	3417
not	3417

how	3418
to	3418
begin	3418
nor	3418
yet	3418
how	3418
to	3418
continue	3418
and	3418
conclude	3418
my	3418
tale	3418
for	3418
the	3418
hand	3419
of	3419
heaven	3419
has	3419
been	3419
laid	3419
heavily	3419
upon	3419
me	3419
firstly	3421
then	3421
i	3421
will	3421
tell	3421
you	3421
my	3421
name	3421
that	3421
you	3421
too	3421
may	3421
know	3421
it	3421
and	3422
one	3422
day	3422
if	3422
i	3422
outlive	3422
this	3422
time	3422
of	3422
sorrow	3422
may	3422
become	3422
my	3422
there	3422

though	3423
i	3423
live	3423
so	3423
far	3423
away	3423
from	3423
all	3423
of	3423
you	3423

am	3423
ulysses	3423
son	3423
of	3424
laertes	3424
reknowned	3424
among	3424
mankind	3424
for	3424
all	3424
manner	3424
of	3424
subtlety	3424
so	3424
that	3425
my	3425
fame	3425
ascends	3425
to	3425
heaven	3425
i	3425
live	3425
in	3425
ithaca	3425
where	3425
there	3425
is	3425
a	3425
high	3426
mountain	3426
called	3426
neritum	3426
covered	3426
with	3426
forests	3426
and	3426
not	3426
far	3426
from	3426
it	3427
there	3427
is	3427
a	3427
group	3427
of	3427
islands	3427
very	3427
near	3427
to	3427
one	3427
another	3427
dulichium	3427
same	3428
and	3428
the	3428
wooded	3428
island	3428
of	3428
zacynthus	3428
it	3428
lies	3428
squat	3428
on	3428
the	3428
horizon	3428
all	3429
highest	3429
up	3429
in	3429
the	3429
sea	3429
towards	3429
the	3429
sunset	3429
while	3429
the	3429
others	3429
lie	3429
away	3430
from	3430
it	3430
towards	3430
dawn	3430
it	3430
is	3430
a	3430
rugged	3430
island	3430
but	3430
it	3430
breeds	3430
brave	3430
men	3431
and	3431
my	3431
eyes	3431
know	3431
none	3431
that	3431
they	3431
better	3431
love	3431
to	3431
look	3431
upon	3431
the	3431
goddess	3432
calypso	3432
kept	3432
me	3432
with	3432
her	3432
in	3432
her	3432
cave	3432
and	3432
wanted	3432
me	3432
to	3432
marry	3432
her	3433
as	3433
did	3433
also	3433
the	3433
cunning	3433
aeaean	3433
goddess	3433
circe	3433
but	3433
they	3433
could	3433
neither	3434
of	3434
them	3434
persuade	3434
me	3434
for	3434
there	3434
is	3434
nothing	3434
dearer	3434
to	3434
a	3434
man	3434
than	3435
his	3435
own	3435
country	3435
and	3435
his	3435
parents	3435
and	3435
however	3435
splendid	3435
a	3435
home	3435
he	3436
may	3436
have	3436
in	3436
a	3436
foreign	3436
country	3436
if	3436
it	3436
be	3436
far	3436
from	3436
father	3436
or	3436
mother	3436
he	3437
does	3437
not	3437
care	3437
about	3437
it	3437
now	3437
however	3437
i	3437
will	3437
tell	3437
you	3437
of	3437
the	3437
many	3437
hazardous	3438
adventures	3438
which	3438
by	3438
jove's	3438
will	3438
i	3438
met	3438
with	3438
on	3438
my	3438
return	3438
from	3439
troy	3439
when	3441
i	3441
had	3441
set	3441
sail	3441
thence	3441
the	3441
wind	3441
took	3441
me	3441
first	3441
to	3441
ismarus	3441
which	3441
is	3442
the	3442
city	3442
of	3442
the	3442
cicons	3442
there	3442
i	3442
sacked	3442
the	3442
town	3442
and	3442
put	3442
the	3442
people	3442
to	3443
the	3443
sword	3443
we	3443
took	3443
their	3443
wives	3443
and	3443
also	3443
much	3443
booty	3443
which	3443
we	3443
divided	3443
equitably	3444
amongst	3444
us	3444
so	3444
that	3444
none	3444
might	3444
have	3444
reason	3444
to	3444
complain	3444
i	3445
then	3445
said	3445
that	3445
we	3445
had	3445
better	3445
make	3445
off	3445
at	3445
once	3445
but	3445
my	3445
men	3445
very	3445
foolishly	3445
would	3446
not	3446
obey	3446
me	3446
so	3446
they	3446
stayed	3446
there	3446
drinking	3446
much	3446
wine	3446
and	3446
killing	3446
great	3447
numbers	3447
of	3447
sheep	3447
and	3447
oxen	3447
on	3447
the	3447
sea	3447
shore	3447
meanwhile	3447
the	3447
cicons	3447
cried	3448
out	3448
for	3448
help	3448
to	3448
other	3448
cicons	3448
who	3448
lived	3448
inland	3448
these	3448
were	3448
more	3448
in	3449
number	3449
and	3449
stronger	3449
and	3449
they	3449
were	3449
more	3449
skilled	3449
in	3449
the	3449
art	3449
of	3449
war	3450
for	3450
they	3450
could	3450
fight	3450
either	3450
from	3450
chariots	3450
or	3450
on	3450
foot	3450
as	3450
the	3450
occasion	3451
served	3451
in	3451
the	3451
morning	3451
therefore	3451
they	3451
came	3451
as	3451
thick	3451
as	3451
leaves	3452
and	3452
bloom	3452
in	3452
summer	3452
and	3452
the	3452
hand	3452
of	3452
heaven	3452
was	3452
against	3452
us	3452
so	3453
that	3453
we	3453
were	3453
hard	3453
pressed	3453
they	3453
set	3453
the	3453
battle	3453
in	3453
array	3453
near	3453
the	3453
ships	3454
and	3454
the	3454
hosts	3454
aimed	3454
their	3454
bronze-shod	3454
spears	3454
at	3454
one	3454
another	3454
so	3455
long	3455
as	3455
the	3455
day	3455
waxed	3455
and	3455
it	3455
was	3455
still	3455
morning	3455
we	3455
held	3455
our	3455
own	3455
against	3456
them	3456
though	3456
they	3456
were	3456
more	3456
in	3456
number	3456
than	3456
we	3456
but	3456
as	3456
the	3456
sun	3457
went	3457
down	3457
towards	3457
the	3457
time	3457
when	3457
men	3457
loose	3457
their	3457
oxen	3457
the	3457
cicons	3457
got	3458
the	3458
better	3458
of	3458
us	3458
and	3458
we	3458
lost	3458
half	3458
a	3458
dozen	3458
men	3458
from	3458
every	3458
ship	3458
we	3459
had	3459
so	3459
we	3459
got	3459
away	3459
with	3459
those	3459
that	3459
were	3459
left	3459
thence	3461
we	3461
sailed	3461
onward	3461
with	3461
sorrow	3461
in	3461
our	3461
hearts	3461
but	3461
glad	3461
to	3461
have	3461
escaped	3462
death	3462
though	3462
we	3462
had	3462
lost	3462
our	3462
comrades	3462
nor	3462
did	3462
we	3462
leave	3462
till	3462
we	3463
had	3463
thrice	3463
invoked	3463
each	3463
one	3463
of	3463
the	3463
poor	3463
fellows	3463
who	3463
had	3463
perished	3463
by	3464
the	3464
hands	3464
of	3464
the	3464
cicons	3464
then	3464
jove	3464
raised	3464
the	3464
north	3464
wind	3464
against	3464
us	3465
till	3465
it	3465
blew	3465
a	3465
hurricane	3465
so	3465
that	3465
land	3465
and	3465
sky	3465
were	3465
hidden	3465
in	3465
thick	3465
clouds	3466
and	3466
night	3466
sprang	3466
forth	3466
out	3466
of	3466
the	3466
heavens	3466
we	3466
let	3466
the	3466
ships	3466
run	3467
before	3467
the	3467
gale	3467
but	3467
the	3467
force	3467
of	3467
the	3467
wind	3467
tore	3467
our	3467
sails	3467
to	3467
tatters	3467
so	3468
we	3468
took	3468
them	3468
down	3468
for	3468
fear	3468
of	3468
shipwreck	3468
and	3468
rowed	3468
our	3468
hardest	3468
towards	3469
the	3469
land	3469
there	3469
we	3469
lay	3469
two	3469
days	3469
and	3469
two	3469
nights	3469
suffering	3469
much	3469
alike	3470
from	3470
toil	3470
and	3470
distress	3470
of	3470
mind	3470
but	3470
on	3470
the	3470
morning	3470
of	3470
the	3470
third	3470
day	3471
we	3471
again	3471
raised	3471
our	3471
masts	3471
set	3471
sail	3471
and	3471
took	3471
our	3471
places	3471
letting	3471
the	3472
wind	3472
and	3472
steersmen	3472
direct	3472
our	3472
ship	3472
i	3472
should	3472
have	3472
got	3472
home	3472
at	3472
that	3473
time	3473
unharmed	3473
had	3473
not	3473
the	3473
north	3473
wind	3473
and	3473
the	3473
currents	3473
been	3473
against	3473
me	3474
as	3474
i	3474
was	3474
doubling	3474
cape	3474
malea	3474
and	3474
set	3474
me	3474
off	3474
my	3474
course	3474
hard	3474
by	3474
the	3475
island	3475
of	3475
cythera	3475
i	3477
was	3477
driven	3477
thence	3477
by	3477
foul	3477
winds	3477
for	3477
a	3477
space	3477
of	3477
nine	3477
days	3477
upon	3477
the	3477
sea	3478
but	3478
on	3478
the	3478
tenth	3478
day	3478
we	3478
reached	3478
the	3478
land	3478
of	3478
the	3478
lotus-eater	3478
who	3479
live	3479
on	3479
a	3479
food	3479
that	3479
comes	3479
from	3479
a	3479
kind	3479
of	3479
flower	3479
here	3479
we	3479
landed	3479
to	3480
take	3480
in	3480
fresh	3480
water	3480
and	3480
our	3480
crews	3480
got	3480
their	3480
mid-day	3480
meal	3480
on	3480
the	3480
shore	3481
near	3481
the	3481
ships	3481
when	3481
they	3481
had	3481
eaten	3481
and	3481
drunk	3481
i	3481
sent	3481
two	3481
of	3481
my	3482
company	3482
to	3482
see	3482
what	3482
manner	3482
of	3482
men	3482
the	3482
people	3482
of	3482
the	3482
place	3482
might	3482
be	3483
and	3483
they	3483
had	3483
a	3483
third	3483
man	3483
under	3483
them	3483
they	3483
started	3483
at	3483
once	3483
and	3483
went	3484
about	3484
among	3484
the	3484
lotus-eaters	3484
who	3484
did	3484
them	3484
no	3484
hurt	3484
but	3484
gave	3484
them	3485
to	3485
eat	3485
of	3485
the	3485
lotus	3485
which	3485
was	3485
so	3485
delicious	3485
that	3485
those	3485
who	3485
ate	3485
of	3486
it	3486
left	3486
off	3486
caring	3486
about	3486
home	3486
and	3486
did	3486
not	3486
even	3486
want	3486
to	3486
go	3486
back	3486
and	3487
say	3487
what	3487
had	3487
happened	3487
to	3487
them	3487
but	3487
were	3487
for	3487
staying	3487
and	3487
munching	3487
lotus	3488
with	3488
the	3488
lotus-eater	3488
without	3488
thinking	3488
further	3488
of	3488
their	3488
return	3488
nevertheless	3489
though	3489
they	3489
wept	3489
bitterly	3489
i	3489
forced	3489
them	3489
back	3489
to	3489
the	3489
ships	3490
and	3490
made	3490
them	3490
fast	3490
under	3490
the	3490
benches	3490
then	3490
i	3490
told	3490
the	3490
rest	3490
to	3490
go	3491
on	3491
board	3491
at	3491
once	3491
lest	3491
any	3491
of	3491
them	3491
should	3491
taste	3491
of	3491
the	3491
lotus	3491
and	3491
leave	3492
off	3492
wanting	3492
to	3492
get	3492
home	3492
so	3492
they	3492
took	3492
their	3492
places	3492
and	3492
smote	3492
the	3493
grey	3493
sea	3493
with	3493
their	3493
oars	3493
we	3495
sailed	3495
hence	3495
always	3495
in	3495
much	3495
distress	3495
till	3495
we	3495
came	3495
to	3495
the	3495
land	3495
of	3496
the	3496
lawless	3496
and	3496
inhuman	3496
cyclopes	3496
now	3496
the	3496
cyclopes	3496
neither	3496
plant	3496
nor	3497
plough	3497
but	3497
trust	3497
in	3497
providence	3497
and	3497
live	3497
on	3497
such	3497
wheat	3497
barley	3497
and	3498
grapes	3498
as	3498
grow	3498
wild	3498
without	3498
any	3498
kind	3498
of	3498
tillage	3498
and	3498
their	3498
wild	3498
grapes	3499
yield	3499
them	3499
wine	3499
as	3499
the	3499
sun	3499
and	3499
the	3499
rain	3499
may	3499
grow	3499
them	3499
they	3499
have	3500
no	3500
laws	3500
nor	3500
assemblies	3500
of	3500
the	3500
people	3500
but	3500
live	3500
in	3500
caves	3500
on	3500
the	3500
tops	3501
of	3501
high	3501
mountains	3501
each	3501
is	3501
lord	3501
and	3501
master	3501
in	3501
his	3501
family	3501
and	3501
they	3502
take	3502
no	3502
account	3502
of	3502
their	3502
neighbours	3502
now	3504
off	3504
their	3504
harbour	3504
there	3504
lies	3504
a	3504
wooded	3504
and	3504
fertile	3504
island	3504
not	3504
quite	3505
close	3505
to	3505
the	3505
land	3505
of	3505
the	3505
cyclopes	3505
but	3505
still	3505
not	3505
far	3505
it	3505
is	3505
overrun	3506
with	3506
wild	3506
goats	3506
that	3506
breed	3506
there	3506
in	3506
great	3506
numbers	3506
and	3506
are	3506
never	3507
disturbed	3507
by	3507
foot	3507
of	3507
man	3507
for	3507
sportsmen	3507
who	3507
as	3507
a	3507
rule	3507
will	3507
suffer	3508
so	3508
much	3508
hardship	3508
in	3508
forest	3508
or	3508
among	3508
mountain	3508
precipices	3508
do	3508
not	3509
go	3509
there	3509
nor	3509
yet	3509
again	3509
is	3509
it	3509
ever	3509
ploughed	3509
or	3509
fed	3509
down	3509
but	3509
it	3509
lies	3510
a	3510
wilderness	3510
untilled	3510
and	3510
unsown	3510
from	3510
year	3510
to	3510
year	3510
and	3510
has	3510
no	3510
living	3511
thing	3511
upon	3511
it	3511
but	3511
only	3511
goats	3511
for	3511
the	3511
cyclopes	3511
have	3511
no	3511
ships	3511
nor	3512
yet	3512
shipwrights	3512
who	3512
could	3512
make	3512
ships	3512
for	3512
them	3512
they	3512
cannot	3512
therefore	3512
go	3513
from	3513
city	3513
to	3513
city	3513
or	3513
sail	3513
over	3513
the	3513
sea	3513
to	3513
one	3513
another's	3513
country	3513
as	3514
people	3514
who	3514
have	3514
ships	3514
can	3514
do	3514
if	3514
they	3514
had	3514
had	3514
these	3514
they	3514
would	3514
have	3515
colonized	3515
the	3515
island	3515
for	3515
it	3515
is	3515
a	3515
very	3515
good	3515
one	3515
and	3515
would	3515
yield	3515
everything	3516
in	3516
due	3516
season	3516
there	3516
are	3516
meadows	3516
that	3516
in	3516
some	3516
places	3516
come	3516
right	3517
down	3517
to	3517
the	3517
sea	3517
shore	3517
well	3517
watered	3517
and	3517
full	3517
of	3517
luscious	3517
grass	3517
grapes	3518
would	3518
do	3518
there	3518
excellently	3518
there	3518
is	3518
level	3518
land	3518
for	3518
ploughing	3518
and	3519
it	3519
would	3519
always	3519
yield	3519
heavily	3519
at	3519
harvest	3519
time	3519
for	3519
the	3519
soil	3519
is	3519
deep	3520
there	3520
is	3520
a	3520
good	3520
harbour	3520
where	3520
no	3520
cables	3520
are	3520
wanted	3520
nor	3520
yet	3520
anchors	3521
nor	3521
need	3521
a	3521
ship	3521
be	3521
moored	3521
but	3521
all	3521
one	3521
has	3521
to	3521
do	3521
is	3521
to	3521
beach	3521
one's	3522
vessel	3522
and	3522
stay	3522
there	3522
till	3522
the	3522
wind	3522
becomes	3522
fair	3522
for	3522
putting	3522
out	3523
to	3523
sea	3523
again	3523
at	3523
the	3523
head	3523
of	3523
the	3523
harbour	3523
there	3523
is	3523
a	3523
spring	3523
of	3523
clear	3524
water	3524
coming	3524
out	3524
of	3524
a	3524
cave	3524
and	3524
there	3524
are	3524
poplars	3524
growing	3524
all	3524
round	3525
it	3525
here	3527
we	3527
entered	3527
but	3527
so	3527
dark	3527
was	3527
the	3527
night	3527
that	3527
some	3527
god	3527
must	3527
have	3527
brought	3528
us	3528
in	3528
for	3528
there	3528
was	3528
nothing	3528
whatever	3528
to	3528
be	3528
seen	3528
a	3528
thick	3528
mist	3529
hung	3529
all	3529
round	3529
our	3529
ships	3529
the	3529
moon	3529
was	3529
hidden	3529
behind	3529
a	3529
mass	3529
of	3529
clouds	3530
so	3530
that	3530
no	3530
one	3530
could	3530
have	3530
seen	3530
the	3530
island	3530
if	3530
he	3530
had	3530
looked	3530
for	3531
it	3531
nor	3531
were	3531
there	3531
any	3531
breakers	3531
to	3531
tell	3531
us	3531
we	3531
were	3531
close	3531
in	3531
shore	3531
before	3532
we	3532
found	3532
ourselves	3532
upon	3532
the	3532
land	3532
itself	3532
when	3532
however	3532
we	3532
had	3533
beached	3533
the	3533
ships	3533
we	3533
took	3533
down	3533
the	3533
sails	3533
went	3533
ashore	3533
and	3533
camped	3533
upon	3534
the	3534
beach	3534
till	3534
daybreak	3534
when	3536
the	3536
child	3536
of	3536
morning	3536
rosy-fingered	3536
dawn	3536
appeared	3536
we	3536
admired	3536
the	3537
island	3537
and	3537
wandered	3537
all	3537
over	3537
it	3537
while	3537
the	3537
nymphs	3537
jove's	3537
daughters	3537
roused	3538
the	3538
wild	3538
goats	3538
that	3538
we	3538
might	3538
get	3538
some	3538
meat	3538
for	3538
our	3538
dinner	3538
on	3539
this	3539
we	3539
fetched	3539
our	3539
spears	3539
and	3539
bows	3539
and	3539
arrows	3539
from	3539
the	3539
ships	3539
and	3540
dividing	3540
ourselves	3540
into	3540
three	3540
bands	3540
began	3540
to	3540
shoot	3540
the	3540
goats	3540
heaven	3541
sent	3541
us	3541
excellent	3541
sport	3541
i	3541
had	3541
twelve	3541
ships	3541
with	3541
me	3541
and	3541
each	3541
ship	3542
got	3542
nine	3542
goats	3542
while	3542
my	3542
own	3542
ship	3542
had	3542
ten	3542
thus	3542
through	3542
the	3542
livelong	3542
day	3543
to	3543
the	3543
going	3543
down	3543
of	3543
the	3543
sun	3543
we	3543
ate	3543
and	3543
drank	3543
our	3543
fill	3543
and	3543
we	3543
had	3544
plenty	3544
of	3544
wine	3544
left	3544
for	3544
each	3544
one	3544
of	3544
us	3544
had	3544
taken	3544
many	3544
jars	3544
full	3544
when	3545
we	3545
sacked	3545
the	3545
city	3545
of	3545
the	3545
cicons	3545
and	3545
this	3545
had	3545
not	3545
yet	3545
run	3545
out	3545
while	3546
we	3546
were	3546
feasting	3546
we	3546
kept	3546
turning	3546
our	3546
eyes	3546
towards	3546
the	3546
land	3546
of	3546
the	3547
cyclopes	3547
which	3547
was	3547
hard	3547
by	3547
and	3547
saw	3547
the	3547
smoke	3547
of	3547
their	3547
stubble	3547
fires	3548
we	3548
could	3548
almost	3548
fancy	3548
we	3548
heard	3548
their	3548
voices	3548
and	3548
the	3548
bleating	3548
of	3549
their	3549
sheep	3549
and	3549
goats	3549
but	3549
when	3549
the	3549
sun	3549
went	3549
down	3549
and	3549
it	3549
came	3549
on	3549
dark	3550
we	3550
camped	3550
down	3550
upon	3550
the	3550
beach	3550
and	3550
next	3550
morning	3550
i	3550
called	3550
a	3550
council	3550
stay	3552
here	3552
my	3552
brave	3552
fellows	3552
said	3552
i	3552
all	3552
the	3552
rest	3552
of	3552
you	3552
while	3552
i	3553
go	3553
with	3553
my	3553
ship	3553
and	3553
exploit	3553
these	3553
people	3553
myself	3553
i	3553
want	3553
to	3553
see	3553
if	3553
they	3554
are	3554
uncivilized	3554
savages	3554
or	3554
a	3554
hospitable	3554
and	3554
humane	3554
race	3554
i	3556
went	3556
on	3556
board	3556
bidding	3556
my	3556
men	3556
to	3556
do	3556
so	3556
also	3556
and	3556
loose	3556
the	3556
hawsers	3556
so	3557
they	3557
took	3557
their	3557
places	3557
and	3557
smote	3557
the	3557
grey	3557
sea	3557
with	3557
their	3557
oars	3557
when	3558
we	3558
got	3558
to	3558
the	3558
land	3558
which	3558
was	3558
not	3558
far	3558
there	3558
on	3558
the	3558
face	3558
of	3558
a	3559
cliff	3559
near	3559
the	3559
sea	3559
we	3559
saw	3559
a	3559
great	3559
cave	3559
overhung	3559
with	3559
laurels	3559
it	3559
was	3560
a	3560
station	3560
for	3560
a	3560
great	3560
many	3560
sheep	3560
and	3560
goats	3560
and	3560
outside	3560
there	3560
was	3561
a	3561
large	3561
yard	3561
with	3561
a	3561
high	3561
wall	3561
round	3561
it	3561
made	3561
of	3561
stones	3561
built	3561
into	3561
the	3562
ground	3562
and	3562
of	3562
trees	3562
both	3562
pine	3562
and	3562
oak	3562
this	3562
was	3562
the	3562
abode	3562
of	3562
a	3562
huge	3563
monster	3563
who	3563
was	3563
then	3563
away	3563
from	3563
home	3563
shepherding	3563
his	3563
flocks	3563
he	3563
would	3564
have	3564
nothing	3564
to	3564
do	3564
with	3564
other	3564
people	3564
but	3564
led	3564
the	3564
life	3564
of	3564
an	3564
outlaw	3565
he	3565
was	3565
a	3565
horrid	3565
creature	3565
not	3565
like	3565
a	3565
human	3565
being	3565
at	3565
all	3565
but	3565
resembling	3566
rather	3566
some	3566
crag	3566
that	3566
stands	3566
out	3566
boldly	3566
against	3566
the	3566
sky	3566
on	3567
the	3567
top	3567
of	3567
a	3567
high	3567
mountain	3567
i	3569
told	3569
my	3569
men	3569
to	3569
draw	3569
the	3569
ship	3569
ashore	3569
and	3569
stay	3569
where	3569
they	3569
were	3569
all	3570
but	3570
the	3570
twelve	3570
best	3570
among	3570
them	3570
who	3570
were	3570
to	3570
go	3570
along	3570
with	3570
myself	3570
i	3571
also	3571
took	3571
a	3571
goatskin	3571
of	3571
sweet	3571
black	3571
wine	3571
which	3571
had	3571
been	3571
given	3571
me	3571
by	3572
maron	3572
apollo	3572
son	3572
of	3572
euanthes	3572
who	3572
was	3572
priest	3572
of	3572
apollo	3572
the	3572
patron	3572
god	3573
of	3573
ismarus	3573
and	3573
lived	3573
within	3573
the	3573
wooded	3573
precincts	3573
of	3573
the	3573
temple	3573
when	3574
we	3574
were	3574
sacking	3574
the	3574
city	3574
we	3574
respected	3574
him	3574
and	3574
spared	3574
his	3574
life	3574
as	3575
also	3575
his	3575
wife	3575
and	3575
child	3575
so	3575
he	3575
made	3575
me	3575
some	3575
presents	3575
of	3575
great	3575
value	3575
seven	3576
talents	3576
of	3576
fine	3576
gold	3576
and	3576
a	3576
bowl	3576
of	3576
silver	3576
with	3576
twelve	3576
jars	3576
of	3577
sweet	3577
wine	3577
unblended	3577
and	3577
of	3577
the	3577
most	3577
exquisite	3577
flavour	3577
not	3577
a	3577
man	3578
nor	3578
maid	3578
in	3578
the	3578
house	3578
knew	3578
about	3578
it	3578
but	3578
only	3578
himself	3578
his	3578
wife	3578
and	3579
one	3579
housekeeper	3579
when	3579
he	3579
drank	3579
it	3579
he	3579
mixed	3579
twenty	3579
parts	3579
of	3579
water	3579
to	3580
one	3580
of	3580
wine	3580
and	3580
yet	3580
the	3580
fragrance	3580
from	3580
the	3580
mixing-bowl	3580
was	3580
so	3580
exquisite	3581
that	3581
it	3581
was	3581
impossible	3581
to	3581
refrain	3581
from	3581
drinking	3581
i	3581
filled	3581
a	3582
large	3582
skin	3582
with	3582
this	3582
wine	3582
and	3582
took	3582
a	3582
wallet	3582
full	3582
of	3582
provisions	3582
with	3583
me	3583
for	3583
my	3583
mind	3583
misgave	3583
me	3583
that	3583
i	3583
might	3583
have	3583
to	3583
deal	3583
with	3583
some	3583
savage	3584
who	3584
would	3584
be	3584
of	3584
great	3584
strength	3584
and	3584
would	3584
respect	3584
neither	3584
right	3584
nor	3585
law	3585
we	3587
soon	3587
reached	3587
his	3587
cave	3587
but	3587
he	3587
was	3587
out	3587
shepherding	3587
so	3587
we	3587
went	3587
inside	3588
and	3588
took	3588
stock	3588
of	3588
all	3588
that	3588
we	3588
could	3588
see	3588
his	3588
cheese-racks	3588
were	3588
loaded	3589
with	3589
cheeses	3589
and	3589
he	3589
had	3589
more	3589
lambs	3589
and	3589
kids	3589
than	3589
his	3589
pens	3589
could	3590
hold	3590
they	3590
were	3590
kept	3590
in	3590
separate	3590
flocks	3590
first	3590
there	3590
were	3590
the	3590
hoggets	3591
then	3591
the	3591
oldest	3591
of	3591
the	3591
younger	3591
lambs	3591
and	3591
lastly	3591
the	3591
very	3591
young	3592
ones	3592
all	3592
kept	3592
apart	3592
from	3592
one	3592
another	3592
as	3592
for	3592
his	3592
dairy	3592
all	3592
the	3593
vessels	3593
bowls	3593
and	3593
milk	3593
pails	3593
into	3593
which	3593
he	3593
milked	3593
were	3593
swimming	3593
with	3594
whey	3594
when	3594
they	3594
saw	3594
all	3594
this	3594
my	3594
men	3594
begged	3594
me	3594
to	3594
let	3594
them	3594
first	3594
steal	3595
some	3595
cheeses	3595
and	3595
make	3595
off	3595
with	3595
them	3595
to	3595
the	3595
ship	3595
they	3595
would	3595
then	3596
return	3596
drive	3596
down	3596
the	3596
lambs	3596
and	3596
kids	3596
put	3596
them	3596
on	3596
board	3596
and	3596
sail	3597
away	3597
with	3597
them	3597
it	3597
would	3597
have	3597
been	3597
indeed	3597
better	3597
if	3597
we	3597
had	3597
done	3597
so	3598
but	3598
i	3598
would	3598
not	3598
listen	3598
to	3598
them	3598
for	3598
i	3598
wanted	3598
to	3598
see	3598
the	3598
owner	3598
himself	3598
in	3599
the	3599
hope	3599
that	3599
he	3599
might	3599
give	3599
me	3599
a	3599
present	3599
when	3599
however	3599
we	3599
saw	3599
him	3600
my	3600
poor	3600
men	3600
found	3600
him	3600
ill	3600
to	3600
deal	3600
with	3600
we	3602
lit	3602
a	3602
fire	3602
offered	3602
some	3602
of	3602
the	3602
cheeses	3602
in	3602
sacrifice	3602
ate	3602
others	3602
of	3603
them	3603
and	3603
then	3603
sat	3603
waiting	3603
till	3603
the	3603
cyclops	3603
should	3603
come	3603
in	3603
with	3603
his	3604
sheep	3604
when	3604
he	3604
came	3604
he	3604
brought	3604
in	3604
with	3604
him	3604
a	3604
huge	3604
load	3604
of	3604
dry	3604
firewood	3605
to	3605
light	3605
the	3605
fire	3605
for	3605
his	3605
supper	3605
and	3605
this	3605
he	3605
flung	3605
with	3605
such	3606
a	3606
noise	3606
on	3606
to	3606
the	3606
floor	3606
of	3606
his	3606
cave	3606
that	3606
we	3606
hid	3606
ourselves	3606
for	3606
fear	3607
at	3607
the	3607
far	3607
end	3607
of	3607
the	3607
cavern	3607
meanwhile	3607
he	3607
drove	3607
all	3607
the	3607
ewes	3607
inside	3608
as	3608
well	3608
as	3608
the	3608
she-goats	3608
that	3608
he	3608
was	3608
going	3608
to	3608
milk	3608
leaving	3608
the	3609
males	3609
both	3609
rams	3609
and	3609
he-goats	3609
outside	3609
in	3609
the	3609
yards	3609
then	3609
he	3609
rolled	3609
a	3610
huge	3610
stone	3610
to	3610
the	3610
mouth	3610
of	3610
the	3610
cave	3610
so	3610
huge	3610
that	3610
two	3610
and	3610
twenty	3610
strong	3611
four-wheeled	3611
waggons	3611
would	3611
not	3611
be	3611
enough	3611
to	3611
draw	3611
it	3611
from	3611
its	3611
place	3612
against	3612
the	3612
doorway	3612
when	3612
he	3612
had	3612
so	3612
done	3612
he	3612
sat	3612
down	3612
and	3612
milked	3612
his	3613
ewes	3613
and	3613
goats	3613
all	3613
in	3613
due	3613
course	3613
and	3613
then	3613
let	3613
each	3613
of	3613
them	3613
have	3613
her	3614
own	3614
young	3614
he	3614
curdled	3614
half	3614
the	3614
milk	3614
and	3614
set	3614
it	3614
aside	3614
in	3614
wicker	3614
strainers	3615
but	3615
the	3615
other	3615
half	3615
he	3615
poured	3615
into	3615
bowls	3615
that	3615
he	3615
might	3615
drink	3615
it	3616
for	3616
his	3616
supper	3616
when	3616
he	3616
had	3616
got	3616
through	3616
with	3616
all	3616
his	3616
work	3616
he	3616
lit	3616
the	3617
fire	3617
and	3617
then	3617
caught	3617
sight	3617
of	3617
us	3617
whereon	3617
he	3617
said	3617
strangers	3619
who	3619
are	3619
you	3619
where	3619
do	3619
sail	3619
from	3619
are	3619
you	3619
traders	3619
or	3619
do	3620
you	3620
sail	3620
the	3620
as	3620
rovers	3620
with	3620
your	3620
hands	3620
against	3620
every	3620
man	3620
and	3620
every	3621
man's	3621
hand	3621
against	3621
you	3621
we	3623
were	3623
frightened	3623
out	3623
of	3623
our	3623
senses	3623
by	3623
his	3623
loud	3623
voice	3623
and	3623
monstrous	3623
form	3624
but	3624
i	3624
managed	3624
to	3624
say	3624
we	3624
are	3624
achaeans	3624
on	3624
our	3624
way	3624
home	3624
from	3624
troy	3625
but	3625
by	3625
the	3625
will	3625
of	3625
jove	3625
and	3625
stress	3625
of	3625
weather	3625
we	3625
have	3625
been	3625
driven	3626
far	3626
out	3626
of	3626
our	3626
course	3626
we	3626
are	3626
the	3626
people	3626
of	3626
agamemnon	3626
son	3626
of	3627
atreus	3627
who	3627
has	3627
won	3627
infinite	3627
renown	3627
throughout	3627
the	3627
whole	3627
world	3627
by	3628
sacking	3628
so	3628
great	3628
a	3628
city	3628
and	3628
killing	3628
so	3628
many	3628
people	3628
we	3628
therefore	3628
humbly	3629
pray	3629
you	3629
to	3629
show	3629
us	3629
some	3629
hospitality	3629
and	3629
otherwise	3629
make	3629
us	3629
such	3630
presents	3630
as	3630
visitors	3630
may	3630
reasonably	3630
expect	3630
may	3630
your	3630
excellency	3630
fear	3631
the	3631
wrath	3631
of	3631
heaven	3631
for	3631
we	3631
are	3631
your	3631
suppliants	3631
and	3631
jove	3631
takes	3631
all	3632
respectable	3632
travellers	3632
under	3632
his	3632
protection	3632
for	3632
he	3632
is	3632
the	3632
avenger	3632
of	3633
all	3633
suppliants	3633
and	3633
foreigners	3633
in	3633
distress	3633
to	3635
this	3635
he	3635
gave	3635
me	3635
but	3635
a	3635
pitiless	3635
answer	3635
stranger	3635
said	3635
he	3635
you	3635
are	3636
a	3636
fool	3636
or	3636
else	3636
you	3636
know	3636
nothing	3636
of	3636
this	3636
country	3636
talk	3636
to	3636
me	3636
indeed	3637
about	3637
fearing	3637
the	3637
gods	3637
or	3637
shunning	3637
their	3637
anger	3637
we	3637
cyclopes	3637
do	3638
not	3638
care	3638
about	3638
jove	3638
or	3638
any	3638
of	3638
your	3638
blessed	3638
gods	3638
for	3638
we	3638
are	3638
ever	3638
so	3639
much	3639
stronger	3639
than	3639
they	3639
i	3639
shall	3639
not	3639
spare	3639
either	3639
yourself	3639
or	3639
your	3639
companions	3640
out	3640
of	3640
any	3640
regard	3640
for	3640
jove	3640
unless	3640
i	3640
am	3640
in	3640
the	3640
humour	3640
for	3640
doing	3641
so	3641
and	3641
now	3641
tell	3641
me	3641
where	3641
you	3641
made	3641
your	3641
ship	3641
fast	3641
when	3641
you	3641
came	3641
on	3642
shore	3642
was	3642
it	3642
round	3642
the	3642
point	3642
or	3642
is	3642
she	3642
lying	3642
straight	3642
off	3642
the	3642
land	3643
he	3645
said	3645
this	3645
to	3645
draw	3645
me	3645
out	3645
but	3645
i	3645
was	3645
too	3645
cunning	3645
to	3645
be	3645
caught	3645
in	3645
that	3646
way	3646
so	3646
i	3646
answered	3646
with	3646
a	3646
lie	3646
neptune	3646
said	3646
i	3646
sent	3646
my	3646
ship	3646
on	3647
to	3647
the	3647
rocks	3647
at	3647
the	3647
far	3647
end	3647
of	3647
your	3647
country	3647
and	3647
wrecked	3647
it	3647
we	3647
were	3648
driven	3648
on	3648
to	3648
them	3648
from	3648
the	3648
open	3648
sea	3648
but	3648
i	3648
and	3648
those	3648
who	3648
are	3648
with	3649
me	3649
escaped	3649
the	3649
jaws	3649
of	3649
death	3649
the	3651
cruel	3651
wretch	3651
vouchsafed	3651
me	3651
not	3651
one	3651
word	3651
of	3651
answer	3651
but	3651
with	3651
a	3651
sudden	3652
clutch	3652
he	3652
gripped	3652
up	3652
two	3652
of	3652
my	3652
men	3652
at	3652
once	3652
and	3652
dashed	3652
them	3652
down	3653
upon	3653
the	3653
ground	3653
as	3653
though	3653
they	3653
had	3653
been	3653
puppies	3653
their	3653
brains	3653
were	3654
shed	3654
upon	3654
the	3654
ground	3654
and	3654
the	3654
earth	3654
was	3654
wet	3654
with	3654
their	3654
blood	3654
then	3655
he	3655
tore	3655
them	3655
limb	3655
from	3655
limb	3655
and	3655
supped	3655
upon	3655
them	3655
he	3655
gobbled	3655
them	3656
up	3656
like	3656
a	3656
lion	3656
in	3656
the	3656
wilderness	3656
flesh	3656
bones	3656
marrow	3656
and	3656
entrails	3656
without	3657
leaving	3657
anything	3657
uneaten	3657
as	3657
for	3657
us	3657
we	3657
wept	3657
and	3657
lifted	3657
up	3657
our	3658
hands	3658
to	3658
heaven	3658
on	3658
seeing	3658
such	3658
a	3658
horrid	3658
sight	3658
for	3658
we	3658
did	3658
not	3658
know	3659
what	3659
else	3659
to	3659
do	3659
but	3659
when	3659
the	3659
cyclops	3659
had	3659
filled	3659
his	3659
huge	3659
paunch	3659
and	3660
had	3660
washed	3660
down	3660
his	3660
meal	3660
of	3660
human	3660
flesh	3660
with	3660
a	3660
drink	3660
of	3660
neat	3660
milk	3660
he	3661
stretched	3661
himself	3661
full	3661
length	3661
upon	3661
the	3661
ground	3661
among	3661
his	3661
sheep	3661
and	3662
went	3662
to	3662
sleep	3662
i	3662
was	3662
at	3662
first	3662
inclined	3662
to	3662
seize	3662
my	3662
sword	3662
draw	3662
it	3663
and	3663
drive	3663
it	3663
into	3663
his	3663
vitals	3663
but	3663
i	3663
reflected	3663
that	3663
if	3663
i	3663
did	3663
we	3663
should	3664
all	3664
certainly	3664
be	3664
lost	3664
for	3664
we	3664
should	3664
never	3664
be	3664
able	3664
to	3664
shift	3664
the	3665
stone	3665
which	3665
the	3665
monster	3665
had	3665
put	3665
in	3665
front	3665
of	3665
the	3665
door	3665
so	3665
we	3665
stayed	3665
sobbing	3666
and	3666
sighing	3666
where	3666
we	3666
were	3666
till	3666
morning	3666
came	3666
when	3668
the	3668
child	3668
of	3668
morning	3668
rosy-fingered	3668
dawn	3668
appeared	3668
he	3668
again	3668
lit	3669
his	3669
fire	3669
milked	3669
his	3669
goats	3669
and	3669
ewes	3669
all	3669
quite	3669
rightly	3669
and	3669
then	3669
let	3670
each	3670
have	3670
her	3670
own	3670
young	3670
one	3670
as	3670
soon	3670
as	3670
he	3670
had	3670
got	3670
through	3670
with	3670
all	3671
his	3671
work	3671
he	3671
clutched	3671
up	3671
two	3671
more	3671
of	3671
my	3671
men	3671
and	3671
began	3671
eating	3671
them	3672
for	3672
his	3672
morning's	3672
meal	3672
presently	3672
with	3672
the	3672
utmost	3672
ease	3672
he	3672
rolled	3672
the	3673
stone	3673
away	3673
from	3673
the	3673
door	3673
and	3673
drove	3673
out	3673
his	3673
sheep	3673
but	3673
he	3673
at	3673
once	3673
put	3674
it	3674
back	3674
again	3674
as	3674
easily	3674
as	3674
though	3674
he	3674
were	3674
merely	3674
clapping	3674
the	3674
lid	3675
on	3675
to	3675
a	3675
quiver	3675
full	3675
of	3675
arrows	3675
as	3675
soon	3675
as	3675
he	3675
had	3675
done	3675
so	3675
he	3675
shouted	3675
and	3676
cried	3676
shoo	3676
shoo	3676
after	3676
his	3676
sheep	3676
to	3676
drive	3676
them	3676
on	3676
to	3676
the	3676
mountain	3676
so	3677
i	3677
was	3677
left	3677
to	3677
scheme	3677
some	3677
way	3677
of	3677
taking	3677
my	3677
revenge	3677
and	3677
covering	3677
myself	3678
with	3678
glory	3678
in	3680
the	3680
end	3680
i	3680
deemed	3680
it	3680
would	3680
be	3680
the	3680
best	3680
plan	3680
to	3680
do	3680
as	3680
follows	3680
the	3680
cyclops	3681
had	3681
a	3681
great	3681
club	3681
which	3681
was	3681
lying	3681
near	3681
one	3681
of	3681
the	3681
sheep	3681
pens	3681
it	3682
was	3682
of	3682
green	3682
olive	3682
wood	3682
and	3682
he	3682
had	3682
cut	3682
it	3682
intending	3682
to	3682
use	3682
it	3682
for	3683
a	3683
staff	3683
as	3683
soon	3683
as	3683
it	3683
should	3683
be	3683
dry	3683
it	3683
was	3683
so	3683
huge	3683
that	3683
we	3683
could	3683
only	3684
compare	3684
it	3684
to	3684
the	3684
mast	3684
of	3684
a	3684
twenty-oared	3684
merchant	3684
vessel	3684
of	3684
large	3684
burden	3685
and	3685
able	3685
to	3685
venture	3685
out	3685
into	3685
open	3685
sea	3685
i	3685
went	3685
up	3685
to	3685
this	3685
club	3685
and	3686
cut	3686
off	3686
about	3686
six	3686
feet	3686
of	3686
it	3686
i	3686
then	3686
gave	3686
this	3686
piece	3686
to	3686
the	3686
men	3686
and	3687
told	3687
them	3687
to	3687
fine	3687
it	3687
evenly	3687
off	3687
at	3687
one	3687
end	3687
which	3687
they	3687
proceeded	3687
to	3688
do	3688
and	3688
lastly	3688
i	3688
brought	3688
it	3688
to	3688
a	3688
point	3688
myself	3688
charring	3688
the	3688
end	3688
in	3689
the	3689
fire	3689
to	3689
make	3689
it	3689
harder	3689
when	3689
i	3689
had	3689
done	3689
this	3689
i	3689
hid	3689
it	3689
under	3689
dung	3690
which	3690
was	3690
lying	3690
about	3690
all	3690
over	3690
the	3690
cave	3690
and	3690
told	3690
the	3690
men	3690
to	3690
cast	3691
lots	3691
which	3691
of	3691
them	3691
should	3691
venture	3691
along	3691
with	3691
myself	3691
to	3691
lift	3691
it	3691
and	3692
bore	3692
it	3692
into	3692
the	3692
monster's	3692
eye	3692
while	3692
he	3692
was	3692
asleep	3692
the	3692
lot	3692
fell	3692
upon	3693
the	3693
very	3693
four	3693
whom	3693
i	3693
should	3693
have	3693
chosen	3693
and	3693
i	3693
myself	3693
made	3693
five	3693
in	3694
the	3694
evening	3694
the	3694
wretch	3694
came	3694
back	3694
from	3694
shepherding	3694
and	3694
drove	3694
his	3694
flocks	3695
into	3695
the	3695
cave	3695
this	3695
time	3695
driving	3695
them	3695
all	3695
inside	3695
and	3695
not	3695
leaving	3695
any	3696
in	3696
the	3696
yards	3696
i	3696
suppose	3696
some	3696
fancy	3696
must	3696
have	3696
taken	3696
him	3696
or	3696
a	3696
god	3696
must	3697
have	3697
prompted	3697
him	3697
to	3697
do	3697
so	3697
as	3697
soon	3697
as	3697
he	3697
had	3697
put	3697
the	3697
stone	3697
back	3697
to	3698
its	3698
place	3698
against	3698
the	3698
door	3698
he	3698
sat	3698
down	3698
milked	3698
his	3698
ewes	3698
and	3698
his	3698
goats	3699
all	3699
quite	3699
rightly	3699
and	3699
then	3699
let	3699
each	3699
have	3699
her	3699
own	3699
young	3699
one	3699
when	3700
he	3700
had	3700
got	3700
through	3700
with	3700
all	3700
this	3700
work	3700
he	3700
gripped	3700
up	3700
two	3700
more	3700
of	3701
my	3701
men	3701
and	3701
made	3701
his	3701
supper	3701
off	3701
them	3701
so	3701
i	3701
went	3701
up	3701
to	3701
him	3701
with	3701
an	3702
ivy-wood	3702
bowl	3702
of	3702
black	3702
wine	3702
in	3702
my	3702
hands	3702
look	3704
here	3704
cyclops	3704
said	3704
i	3704
you	3704
have	3704
been	3704
eating	3704
a	3704
great	3704
deal	3704
of	3704
man's	3705
flesh	3705
so	3705
take	3705
this	3705
and	3705
drink	3705
some	3705
wine	3705
that	3705
you	3705
may	3705
see	3705
what	3705
kind	3706
of	3706
liquor	3706
we	3706
had	3706
on	3706
board	3706
my	3706
ship	3706
i	3706
was	3706
bringing	3706
it	3706
to	3706
you	3706
as	3706
a	3707
drink-offering	3707
in	3707
the	3707
hope	3707
that	3707
you	3707
would	3707
take	3707
compassion	3707
upon	3707
me	3708
and	3708
further	3708
me	3708
on	3708
my	3708
way	3708
home	3708
whereas	3708
all	3708
you	3708
do	3708
is	3708
to	3708
go	3708
on	3708
ramping	3708
and	3709
raving	3709
most	3709
intolerably	3709
you	3709
ought	3709
to	3709
be	3709
ashamed	3709
yourself	3709
how	3709
can	3710
you	3710
expect	3710
people	3710
to	3710
come	3710
see	3710
you	3710
any	3710
more	3710
if	3710
you	3710
treat	3710
them	3710
in	3710
this	3711
way	3711
he	3713
then	3713
took	3713
the	3713
cup	3713
and	3713
drank	3713
he	3713
was	3713
so	3713
delighted	3713
with	3713
the	3713
taste	3713
of	3714
the	3714
wine	3714
that	3714
he	3714
begged	3714
me	3714
for	3714
another	3714
bowl	3714
full	3714
be	3714
so	3714
kind	3714
he	3715
said	3715
as	3715
to	3715
give	3715
me	3715
some	3715
more	3715
and	3715
tell	3715
me	3715
your	3715
name	3715
at	3715
once	3715
i	3716
want	3716
to	3716
make	3716
you	3716
a	3716
present	3716
that	3716
you	3716
will	3716
be	3716
glad	3716
to	3716
have	3716
we	3716
have	3716
wine	3717
even	3717
in	3717
this	3717
country	3717
for	3717
our	3717
soil	3717
grows	3717
grapes	3717
and	3717
the	3717
sun	3717
ripens	3717
them	3718
but	3718
this	3718
drinks	3718
like	3718
nectar	3718
and	3718
ambrosia	3718
all	3718
in	3718
one	3718
i	3720
then	3720
gave	3720
him	3720
some	3720
more	3720
three	3720
times	3720
did	3720
i	3720
fill	3720
the	3720
bowl	3720
for	3720
him	3720
and	3721
three	3721
times	3721
did	3721
he	3721
drain	3721
it	3721
without	3721
thought	3721
or	3721
heed	3721
then	3721
when	3721
i	3722
saw	3722
that	3722
the	3722
wine	3722
had	3722
got	3722
into	3722
his	3722
head	3722
i	3722
said	3722
to	3722
him	3722
as	3722
plausibly	3722
as	3723
i	3723
could	3723
cyclops	3723
you	3723
ask	3723
my	3723
name	3723
and	3723
i	3723
will	3723
tell	3723
it	3723
you	3723
give	3723
me	3724
therefore	3724
the	3724
present	3724
you	3724
promised	3724
me	3724
my	3724
name	3724
is	3724
noman	3724
this	3724
is	3725
what	3725
my	3725
father	3725
and	3725
mother	3725
and	3725
my	3725
friends	3725
have	3725
always	3725
called	3725
me	3725
but	3727
the	3727
cruel	3727
wretch	3727
said	3727
then	3727
i	3727
will	3727
eat	3727
all	3727
noman's	3727
comrades	3727
before	3728
noman	3728
himself	3728
and	3728
will	3728
keep	3728
noman	3728
for	3728
the	3728
last	3728
this	3728
is	3728
the	3728
present	3729
that	3729
i	3729
will	3729
make	3729
him	3729
as	3731
he	3731
spoke	3731
he	3731
reeled	3731
and	3731
fell	3731
sprawling	3731
face	3731
upwards	3731
on	3731
the	3731
ground	3731
his	3732
great	3732
neck	3732
hung	3732
heavily	3732
backwards	3732
and	3732
a	3732
deep	3732
sleep	3732
took	3732
hold	3732
upon	3732
him	3733
presently	3733
he	3733
turned	3733
sick	3733
and	3733
threw	3733
up	3733
both	3733
wine	3733
and	3733
the	3733
gobbets	3733
of	3734
human	3734
flesh	3734
on	3734
which	3734
he	3734
had	3734
been	3734
gorging	3734
for	3734
he	3734
was	3734
very	3734
drunk	3734
then	3735
i	3735
thrust	3735
the	3735
beam	3735
of	3735
wood	3735
far	3735
into	3735
the	3735
embers	3735
to	3735
heat	3735
it	3735
and	3735
encouraged	3736
my	3736
men	3736
lest	3736
any	3736
of	3736
them	3736
should	3736
turn	3736
faint-hearted	3736
when	3736
the	3737
wood	3737
green	3737
though	3737
it	3737
was	3737
was	3737
about	3737
to	3737
blaze	3737
i	3737
drew	3737
it	3737
out	3737
of	3737
the	3738
fire	3738
glowing	3738
with	3738
heat	3738
and	3738
my	3738
men	3738
gathered	3738
round	3738
me	3738
for	3738
heaven	3738
had	3739
filled	3739
their	3739
hearts	3739
with	3739
courage	3739
we	3739
drove	3739
the	3739
sharp	3739
end	3739
of	3739
the	3739
beam	3740
into	3740
the	3740
monster's	3740
eye	3740
and	3740
bearing	3740
upon	3740
it	3740
with	3740
all	3740
my	3740
weight	3740
i	3741
kept	3741
turning	3741
it	3741
round	3741
and	3741
round	3741
as	3741
though	3741
i	3741
were	3741
boring	3741
a	3741
hole	3741
in	3741
a	3742
ship's	3742
plank	3742
with	3742
an	3742
auger	3742
which	3742
two	3742
men	3742
with	3742
a	3742
wheel	3742
and	3742
strap	3742
can	3743
keep	3743
on	3743
turning	3743
as	3743
long	3743
as	3743
they	3743
choose	3743
even	3743
thus	3743
did	3743
we	3743
bore	3743
the	3744
red	3744
hot	3744
beam	3744
into	3744
his	3744
eye	3744
till	3744
the	3744
boiling	3744
blood	3744
bubbled	3744
all	3744
over	3745
it	3745
as	3745
we	3745
worked	3745
it	3745
round	3745
and	3745
round	3745
so	3745
that	3745
the	3745
steam	3745
from	3745
the	3745
burning	3746
eyeball	3746
scalded	3746
his	3746
eyelids	3746
and	3746
eyebrows	3746
and	3746
the	3746
roots	3746
of	3746
the	3747
eye	3747
sputtered	3747
in	3747
the	3747
fire	3747
as	3747
a	3747
blacksmith	3747
plunges	3747
an	3747
axe	3747
or	3747
hatchet	3747
into	3748
cold	3748
water	3748
to	3748
temper	3748
it	3748
for	3748
it	3748
is	3748
this	3748
that	3748
gives	3748
strength	3748
to	3748
the	3749
iron	3749
and	3749
it	3749
makes	3749
a	3749
great	3749
hiss	3749
as	3749
he	3749
does	3749
so	3749
even	3749
thus	3749
did	3749
the	3749
cyclops	3750
eye	3750
hiss	3750
round	3750
the	3750
beam	3750
of	3750
olive	3750
wood	3750
and	3750
his	3750
hideous	3750
yells	3750
made	3751
the	3751
cave	3751
ring	3751
again	3751
we	3751
ran	3751
away	3751
in	3751
a	3751
fright	3751
but	3751
he	3751
plucked	3751
the	3752
beam	3752
all	3752
besmirched	3752
with	3752
gore	3752
from	3752
his	3752
eye	3752
and	3752
hurled	3752
it	3752
from	3752
him	3753
in	3753
a	3753
frenzy	3753
of	3753
rage	3753
and	3753
pain	3753
shouting	3753
as	3753
he	3753
did	3753
so	3753
to	3753
the	3753
other	3753
cyclopes	3754
who	3754
lived	3754
on	3754
the	3754
bleak	3754
headlands	3754
near	3754
him	3754
so	3754
they	3754
gathered	3754
from	3755
all	3755
quarters	3755
round	3755
his	3755
cave	3755
when	3755
they	3755
heard	3755
him	3755
crying	3755
and	3755
asked	3755
what	3756
was	3756
the	3756
matter	3756
with	3756
him	3756
what	3758
ails	3758
you	3758
polyphemus	3758
said	3758
they	3758
that	3758
you	3758
make	3758
such	3758
a	3758
noise	3758
breaking	3759
the	3759
stillness	3759
of	3759
the	3759
night	3759
and	3759
preventing	3759
us	3759
from	3759
being	3759
able	3760
to	3760
sleep	3760
surely	3760
no	3760
man	3760
is	3760
carrying	3760
off	3760
your	3760
sheep	3760
surely	3760
no	3760
man	3761
is	3761
trying	3761
to	3761
kill	3761
you	3761
either	3761
by	3761
fraud	3761
or	3761
by	3761
force	3761
but	3763
polyphemus	3763
shouted	3763
to	3763
them	3763
from	3763
inside	3763
the	3763
cave	3763
noman	3763
is	3763
killing	3763
me	3764
by	3764
fraud	3764
noman	3764
is	3764
killing	3764
me	3764
by	3764
force	3764
then	3766
said	3766
they	3766
if	3766
no	3766
man	3766
is	3766
attacking	3766
you	3766
you	3766
must	3766
be	3766
ill	3766
when	3767
jove	3767
makes	3767
people	3767
ill	3767
there	3767
is	3767
no	3767
help	3767
for	3767
it	3767
and	3767
you	3767
had	3767
better	3767
pray	3768
to	3768
your	3768
father	3768
neptune	3768
then	3770
they	3770
went	3770
away	3770
and	3770
i	3770
laughed	3770
inwardly	3770
at	3770
the	3770
success	3770
of	3770
my	3770
clever	3771
stratagem	3771
but	3771
the	3771
cyclops	3771
groaning	3771
and	3771
in	3771
an	3771
agony	3771
of	3771
pain	3771
felt	3772
about	3772
with	3772
his	3772
hands	3772
till	3772
he	3772
found	3772
the	3772
stone	3772
and	3772
took	3772
it	3772
from	3772
the	3773
door	3773
then	3773
he	3773
sat	3773
in	3773
the	3773
doorway	3773
and	3773
stretched	3773
his	3773
hands	3773
in	3773
front	3773
of	3774
it	3774
to	3774
catch	3774
anyone	3774
going	3774
out	3774
with	3774
the	3774
sheep	3774
for	3774
he	3774
thought	3774
i	3774
might	3774
be	3775
foolish	3775
enough	3775
to	3775
attempt	3775
this	3775
as	3777
for	3777
myself	3777
i	3777
kept	3777
on	3777
puzzling	3777
to	3777
think	3777
how	3777
i	3777
could	3777
best	3777
save	3777
my	3777
own	3778
life	3778
and	3778
those	3778
of	3778
my	3778
companions	3778
i	3778
schemed	3778
and	3778
schemed	3778
as	3778
one	3778
who	3779
knows	3779
that	3779
his	3779
life	3779
depends	3779
upon	3779
it	3779
for	3779
the	3779
danger	3779
was	3779
very	3779
great	3779
in	3780
the	3780
end	3780
i	3780
deemed	3780
that	3780
this	3780
plan	3780
would	3780
be	3780
the	3780
best	3780
the	3780
male	3780
sheep	3780
were	3781
well	3781
grown	3781
and	3781
carried	3781
a	3781
heavy	3781
black	3781
fleece	3781
so	3781
i	3781
bound	3781
them	3781
noiselessly	3782
in	3782
threes	3782
together	3782
with	3782
some	3782
of	3782
the	3782
withies	3782
on	3782
which	3782
the	3783
wicked	3783
monster	3783
used	3783
to	3783
sleep	3783
there	3783
was	3783
to	3783
be	3783
a	3783
man	3783
under	3783
the	3783
middle	3784
sheep	3784
and	3784
the	3784
two	3784
on	3784
either	3784
side	3784
were	3784
to	3784
cover	3784
him	3784
so	3784
that	3784
there	3785
were	3785
three	3785
sheep	3785
to	3785
each	3785
man	3785
as	3785
for	3785
myself	3785
there	3785
was	3785
a	3785
ram	3785
finer	3786
than	3786
any	3786
of	3786
the	3786
others	3786
so	3786
i	3786
caught	3786
hold	3786
of	3786
him	3786
by	3786
the	3786
back	3786
esconced	3787
myself	3787
in	3787
the	3787
thick	3787
wool	3787
under	3787
his	3787
belly	3787
and	3787
flung	3787
on	3787
patiently	3787
to	3788
his	3788
fleece	3788
face	3788
upwards	3788
keeping	3788
a	3788
firm	3788
hold	3788
on	3788
it	3788
all	3788
the	3788
time	3788
thus	3790
then	3790
did	3790
we	3790
wait	3790
in	3790
great	3790
fear	3790
of	3790
mind	3790
till	3790
morning	3790
came	3790
but	3791
when	3791
the	3791
child	3791
of	3791
morning	3791
rosy-fingered	3791
dawn	3791
appeared	3791
the	3791
male	3791
sheep	3792
hurried	3792
out	3792
to	3792
feed	3792
while	3792
the	3792
ewes	3792
remained	3792
bleating	3792
about	3792
the	3793
pens	3793
waiting	3793
to	3793
be	3793
milked	3793
for	3793
their	3793
udders	3793
were	3793
full	3793
to	3793
bursting	3793
but	3794
their	3794
master	3794
in	3794
spite	3794
of	3794
all	3794
his	3794
pain	3794
felt	3794
the	3794
backs	3794
of	3794
all	3794
the	3794
sheep	3795
as	3795
they	3795
stood	3795
upright	3795
without	3795
being	3795
sharp	3795
enough	3795
to	3795
find	3795
out	3795
that	3796
the	3796
men	3796
were	3796
underneath	3796
their	3796
bellies	3796
as	3796
the	3796
ram	3796
was	3796
going	3796
out	3796
last	3797
of	3797
all	3797
heavy	3797
with	3797
its	3797
fleece	3797
and	3797
with	3797
the	3797
weight	3797
of	3797
my	3797
crafty	3797
self	3798
polyphemus	3798
laid	3798
hold	3798
of	3798
it	3798
and	3798
said	3798
my	3800
good	3800
ram	3800
what	3800
is	3800
it	3800
that	3800
makes	3800
you	3800
the	3800
last	3800
to	3800
leave	3800
my	3800
cave	3800
this	3801
morning	3801
you	3801
are	3801
not	3801
wont	3801
to	3801
let	3801
the	3801
ewes	3801
go	3801
before	3801
you	3801
but	3801
lead	3802
the	3802
mob	3802
with	3802
a	3802
run	3802
whether	3802
to	3802
flowery	3802
mead	3802
or	3802
bubbling	3802
fountain	3802
and	3803
are	3803
the	3803
first	3803
to	3803
come	3803
home	3803
again	3803
at	3803
night	3803
but	3803
now	3803
you	3803
lag	3803
last	3803
of	3804
all	3804
is	3804
it	3804
because	3804
you	3804
know	3804
your	3804
master	3804
has	3804
lost	3804
his	3804
eye	3804
and	3804
are	3804
sorry	3805
because	3805
that	3805
wicked	3805
noman	3805
and	3805
his	3805
horrid	3805
crew	3805
have	3805
got	3805
him	3805
down	3805
in	3806
his	3806
drink	3806
and	3806
blinded	3806
him	3806
but	3806
i	3806
will	3806
have	3806
his	3806
life	3806
yet	3806
if	3806
you	3806
could	3807
understand	3807
and	3807
talk	3807
you	3807
would	3807
tell	3807
me	3807
where	3807
the	3807
wretch	3807
is	3807
hiding	3807
and	3808
i	3808
would	3808
dash	3808
his	3808
brains	3808
upon	3808
the	3808
ground	3808
till	3808
they	3808
flew	3808
all	3808
over	3808
the	3809
cave	3809
i	3809
should	3809
thus	3809
have	3809
some	3809
satisfaction	3809
for	3809
the	3809
harm	3809
a	3809
this	3809
no-good	3810
noman	3810
has	3810
done	3810
me	3810
as	3812
spoke	3812
he	3812
drove	3812
the	3812
ram	3812
outside	3812
but	3812
when	3812
we	3812
were	3812
a	3812
little	3812
way	3812
out	3813
from	3813
the	3813
cave	3813
and	3813
yards	3813
i	3813
first	3813
got	3813
from	3813
under	3813
the	3813
ram's	3813
belly	3813
and	3814
then	3814
freed	3814
my	3814
comrades	3814
as	3814
for	3814
the	3814
sheep	3814
which	3814
were	3814
very	3814
fat	3814
by	3815
constantly	3815
heading	3815
them	3815
in	3815
the	3815
right	3815
direction	3815
we	3815
managed	3815
to	3815
drive	3815
them	3816
down	3816
to	3816
the	3816
ship	3816
the	3816
crew	3816
rejoiced	3816
greatly	3816
at	3816
seeing	3816
those	3816
of	3816
us	3817
who	3817
had	3817
escaped	3817
death	3817
but	3817
wept	3817
for	3817
the	3817
others	3817
whom	3817
the	3817
cyclops	3817
had	3818
killed	3818
however	3818
i	3818
made	3818
signs	3818
to	3818
them	3818
by	3818
nodding	3818
and	3818
frowning	3818
that	3819
they	3819
were	3819
to	3819
hush	3819
their	3819
crying	3819
and	3819
told	3819
them	3819
to	3819
get	3819
all	3819
the	3819
sheep	3820
on	3820
board	3820
at	3820
once	3820
and	3820
put	3820
out	3820
to	3820
sea	3820
so	3820
they	3820
went	3820
aboard	3820
took	3820
their	3821
places	3821
and	3821
smote	3821
the	3821
grey	3821
sea	3821
with	3821
their	3821
oars	3821
then	3821
when	3821
i	3821
had	3822
got	3822
as	3822
far	3822
out	3822
as	3822
my	3822
voice	3822
would	3822
reach	3822
i	3822
began	3822
to	3822
jeer	3822
at	3822
the	3822
cyclops	3823
cyclops	3825
said	3825
i	3825
you	3825
should	3825
have	3825
taken	3825
better	3825
measure	3825
of	3825
your	3825
man	3826
before	3826
eating	3826
up	3826
his	3826
comrades	3826
in	3826
your	3826
cave	3826
you	3826
wretch	3826
eat	3826
up	3826
your	3827
visitors	3827
in	3827
your	3827
own	3827
house	3827
you	3827
might	3827
have	3827
known	3827
that	3827
your	3827
sin	3827
would	3828
find	3828
you	3828
out	3828
and	3828
now	3828
jove	3828
and	3828
the	3828
other	3828
gods	3828
have	3828
punished	3828
you	3829
he	3831
got	3831
more	3831
and	3831
more	3831
furious	3831
as	3831
he	3831
heard	3831
me	3831
so	3831
he	3831
tore	3831
the	3831
top	3831
from	3831
off	3832
a	3832
high	3832
mountain	3832
and	3832
flung	3832
it	3832
just	3832
in	3832
front	3832
of	3832
my	3832
ship	3832
so	3832
that	3832
it	3833
was	3833
within	3833
a	3833
little	3833
of	3833
hitting	3833
the	3833
end	3833
of	3833
the	3833
rudder	3833
the	3833
sea	3833
quaked	3833
as	3834
the	3834
rock	3834
fell	3834
into	3834
it	3834
and	3834
the	3834
wash	3834
of	3834
the	3834
wave	3834
it	3834
raised	3834
carried	3834
us	3835
back	3835
towards	3835
the	3835
mainland	3835
and	3835
forced	3835
us	3835
towards	3835
the	3835
shore	3835
but	3835
i	3836
snatched	3836
up	3836
a	3836
long	3836
pole	3836
and	3836
kept	3836
the	3836
ship	3836
off	3836
making	3836
signs	3836
to	3836
my	3836
men	3837
by	3837
nodding	3837
my	3837
head	3837
that	3837
they	3837
must	3837
row	3837
for	3837
their	3837
lives	3837
whereon	3837
they	3838
laid	3838
out	3838
with	3838
a	3838
will	3838
when	3838
we	3838
had	3838
got	3838
twice	3838
as	3838
far	3838
as	3838
we	3838
were	3838
before	3839
i	3839
was	3839
for	3839
jeering	3839
at	3839
the	3839
cyclops	3839
again	3839
but	3839
the	3839
men	3839
begged	3839
and	3840
prayed	3840
of	3840
me	3840
to	3840
hold	3840
my	3840
tongue	3840
do	3842
not	3842
they	3842
exclaimed	3842
be	3842
mad	3842
enough	3842
to	3842
provoke	3842
this	3842
savage	3842
creature	3842
further	3843
he	3843
has	3843
thrown	3843
one	3843
rock	3843
at	3843
us	3843
already	3843
which	3843
drove	3843
us	3843
back	3843
again	3844
to	3844
the	3844
mainland	3844
and	3844
we	3844
made	3844
sure	3844
it	3844
had	3844
been	3844
the	3844
death	3844
of	3844
us	3844
if	3845
he	3845
had	3845
then	3845
heard	3845
any	3845
further	3845
sound	3845
of	3845
voices	3845
he	3845
would	3845
have	3845
pounded	3845
our	3846
heads	3846
and	3846
our	3846
ship's	3846
timbers	3846
into	3846
a	3846
jelly	3846
with	3846
the	3846
rugged	3846
rocks	3846
he	3847
would	3847
have	3847
heaved	3847
at	3847
us	3847
for	3847
he	3847
can	3847
throw	3847
them	3847
a	3847
long	3847
way	3847
but	3849
i	3849
would	3849
not	3849
listen	3849
to	3849
them	3849
and	3849
shouted	3849
out	3849
to	3849
him	3849
in	3849
my	3849
rage	3849
cyclops	3850
if	3850
any	3850
one	3850
asks	3850
you	3850
who	3850
it	3850
was	3850
that	3850
put	3850
your	3850
eye	3850
out	3850
and	3850
spoiled	3851
your	3851
beauty	3851
say	3851
it	3851
was	3851
the	3851
valiant	3851
warrior	3851
ulysses	3851
son	3851
of	3851
laertes	3852
who	3852
lives	3852
in	3852
ithaca	3852
on	3854
this	3854
he	3854
groaned	3854
and	3854
cried	3854
out	3854
alas	3854
alas	3854
then	3854
the	3854
old	3854
prophecy	3854
about	3855
me	3855
is	3855
coming	3855
true	3855
there	3855
was	3855
a	3855
prophet	3855
here	3855
at	3855
one	3855
time	3855
a	3855
man	3856
both	3856
brave	3856
and	3856
of	3856
great	3856
stature	3856
telemus	3856
son	3856
of	3856
eurymus	3856
who	3856
was	3856
an	3857
excellent	3857
seer	3857
and	3857
did	3857
all	3857
the	3857
prophesying	3857
for	3857
the	3857
cyclopes	3857
till	3857
he	3858
grew	3858
old	3858
he	3858
told	3858
me	3858
that	3858
all	3858
this	3858
would	3858
happen	3858
to	3858
me	3858
some	3858
day	3858
and	3859
said	3859
i	3859
should	3859
lose	3859
my	3859
sight	3859
by	3859
the	3859
hand	3859
of	3859
ulysses	3859
i	3859
have	3859
been	3859
all	3860
along	3860
expecting	3860
some	3860
one	3860
of	3860
imposing	3860
presence	3860
and	3860
superhuman	3860
strength	3860
whereas	3861
he	3861
turns	3861
out	3861
to	3861
be	3861
a	3861
little	3861
insignificant	3861
weakling	3861
who	3861
has	3861
managed	3862
to	3862
blind	3862
my	3862
eye	3862
by	3862
taking	3862
advantage	3862
of	3862
me	3862
in	3862
my	3862
drink	3862
come	3862
here	3863
then	3863
ulysses	3863
that	3863
i	3863
may	3863
make	3863
you	3863
presents	3863
to	3863
show	3863
my	3863
hospitality	3863
and	3864
urge	3864
neptune	3864
to	3864
help	3864
you	3864
forward	3864
on	3864
your	3864
journey	3864
for	3864
neptune	3864
and	3865
i	3865
are	3865
father	3865
and	3865
son	3865
he	3865
if	3865
he	3865
so	3865
will	3865
shall	3865
heal	3865
me	3865
which	3865
no	3866
one	3866
else	3866
neither	3866
god	3866
nor	3866
man	3866
can	3866
do	3866
then	3868
i	3868
said	3868
i	3868
wish	3868
i	3868
could	3868
be	3868
as	3868
sure	3868
of	3868
killing	3868
you	3868
outright	3868
and	3868
sending	3869
you	3869
down	3869
to	3869
the	3869
house	3869
of	3869
hades	3869
as	3869
i	3869
am	3869
that	3869
it	3869
will	3869
take	3869
more	3870
than	3870
neptune	3870
to	3870
cure	3870
that	3870
eye	3870
of	3870
yours	3870
on	3872
this	3872
he	3872
lifted	3872
up	3872
his	3872
hands	3872
to	3872
the	3872
firmament	3872
of	3872
heaven	3872
and	3872
prayed	3872
saying	3873
hear	3873
me	3873
great	3873
neptune	3873
if	3873
i	3873
am	3873
indeed	3873
your	3873
own	3873
true-begotten	3873
son	3874
grant	3874
that	3874
ulysses	3874
may	3874
never	3874
reach	3874
his	3874
home	3874
alive	3874
or	3874
if	3874
he	3874
must	3874
get	3875
back	3875
to	3875
his	3875
friends	3875
at	3875
last	3875
let	3875
him	3875
do	3875
so	3875
late	3875
and	3875
in	3875
sore	3875
plight	3875
after	3876
losing	3876
all	3876
his	3876
men	3876
let	3876
him	3876
reach	3876
his	3876
home	3876
in	3876
another	3876
man's	3876
ship	3877
and	3877
find	3877
trouble	3877
in	3877
his	3877
house	3877
thus	3879
did	3879
he	3879
pray	3879
and	3879
neptune	3879
heard	3879
his	3879
prayer	3879
then	3879
he	3879
picked	3879
up	3879
a	3880
rock	3880
much	3880
larger	3880
than	3880
the	3880
first	3880
swung	3880
it	3880
aloft	3880
and	3880
hurled	3880
it	3880
with	3880
prodigious	3881
force	3881
it	3881
fell	3881
just	3881
short	3881
of	3881
the	3881
ship	3881
but	3881
was	3881
within	3881
a	3881
little	3882
of	3882
hitting	3882
the	3882
end	3882
of	3882
the	3882
rudder	3882
the	3882
sea	3882
quaked	3882
as	3882
the	3882
rock	3882
fell	3883
into	3883
it	3883
and	3883
the	3883
wash	3883
of	3883
the	3883
wave	3883
it	3883
raised	3883
drove	3883
us	3883
onwards	3883
on	3884
our	3884
way	3884
towards	3884
the	3884
shore	3884
of	3884
the	3884
island	3884
when	3886
at	3886
last	3886
we	3886
got	3886
to	3886
the	3886
island	3886
where	3886
we	3886
had	3886
left	3886
the	3886
rest	3886
of	3886
our	3886
ships	3887
we	3887
found	3887
our	3887
comrades	3887
lamenting	3887
us	3887
and	3887
anxiously	3887
awaiting	3887
our	3888
return	3888
we	3888
ran	3888
our	3888
vessel	3888
upon	3888
the	3888
sands	3888
and	3888
got	3888
out	3888
of	3888
her	3888
on	3888
to	3889
the	3889
sea	3889
shore	3889
we	3889
also	3889
landed	3889
the	3889
cyclops	3889
sheep	3889
and	3889
divided	3889
them	3889
equitably	3890
amongst	3890
us	3890
so	3890
that	3890
none	3890
might	3890
have	3890
reason	3890
to	3890
complain	3890
as	3890
for	3891
the	3891
ram	3891
my	3891
companions	3891
agreed	3891
that	3891
i	3891
should	3891
have	3891
it	3891
as	3891
an	3891
extra	3891
share	3892
so	3892
i	3892
sacrificed	3892
it	3892
on	3892
the	3892
sea	3892
shore	3892
and	3892
burned	3892
its	3892
thigh	3892
bones	3892
to	3893
jove	3893
who	3893
is	3893
the	3893
lord	3893
of	3893
all	3893
but	3893
he	3893
heeded	3893
not	3893
my	3893
sacrifice	3893
and	3893
only	3894
thought	3894
how	3894
he	3894
might	3894
destroy	3894
my	3894
ships	3894
and	3894
my	3894
comrades	3894
thus	3896
through	3896
the	3896
livelong	3896
day	3896
to	3896
the	3896
going	3896
down	3896
of	3896
the	3896
sun	3896
we	3896
feasted	3896
our	3897
fill	3897
on	3897
meat	3897
and	3897
drink	3897
but	3897
when	3897
the	3897
sun	3897
went	3897
down	3897
and	3897
it	3897
came	3897
on	3898
dark	3898
we	3898
camped	3898
upon	3898
the	3898
beach	3898
when	3898
the	3898
child	3898
of	3898
morning	3898
rosy-fingered	3898
dawn	3899
appeared	3899
i	3899
bade	3899
my	3899
men	3899
on	3899
board	3899
and	3899
loose	3899
the	3899
hawsers	3899
then	3899
they	3900
took	3900
their	3900
places	3900
and	3900
smote	3900
the	3900
grey	3900
sea	3900
with	3900
their	3900
oars	3900
so	3900
we	3901
sailed	3901
on	3901
with	3901
sorrow	3901
in	3901
our	3901
hearts	3901
but	3901
glad	3901
to	3901
have	3901
escaped	3901
death	3901
though	3902
we	3902
had	3902
lost	3902
our	3902
comrades	3902
book	3906
x	3906
thence	3908
we	3908
went	3908
on	3908
to	3908
the	3908
aeoli	3908
island	3908
where	3908
lives	3908
aeolus	3908
son	3908
of	3908
hippotas	3908
dear	3909
to	3909
the	3909
immortal	3909
gods	3909
it	3909
is	3909
an	3909
island	3909
that	3909
floats	3909
as	3909
it	3909
were	3909
upon	3910
the	3910
sea	3910
iron	3910
bound	3910
with	3910
a	3910
wall	3910
that	3910
girds	3910
it	3910
now	3910
aeolus	3910
has	3910
six	3911
daughters	3911
and	3911
six	3911
lusty	3911
sons	3911
so	3911
he	3911
made	3911
the	3911
sons	3911
marry	3911
the	3911
daughters	3911
and	3912
they	3912
all	3912
live	3912
with	3912
their	3912
dear	3912
father	3912
and	3912
mother	3912
feasting	3912
and	3912
enjoying	3913
every	3913
conceivable	3913
kind	3913
of	3913
luxury	3913
all	3913
day	3913
long	3913
the	3913
atmosphere	3913
of	3914
the	3914
house	3914
is	3914
loaded	3914
with	3914
the	3914
savour	3914
of	3914
roasting	3914
meats	3914
till	3914
it	3914
groans	3914
again	3915
yard	3915
and	3915
all	3915
but	3915
by	3915
night	3915
they	3915
sleep	3915
on	3915
their	3915
well-made	3915
bedsteads	3915
each	3916
with	3916
his	3916
own	3916
wife	3916
between	3916
the	3916
blankets	3916
these	3916
were	3916
the	3916
people	3916
among	3917
whom	3917
we	3917
had	3917
now	3917
come	3917
aeolus	3919
entertained	3919
me	3919
for	3919
a	3919
whole	3919
month	3919
asking	3919
me	3919
questions	3919
all	3919
the	3919
time	3920
about	3920
troy	3920
the	3920
argive	3920
fleet	3920
and	3920
the	3920
return	3920
of	3920
the	3920
achaeans	3920
i	3921
told	3921
him	3921
exactly	3921
how	3921
everything	3921
had	3921
happened	3921
and	3921
when	3921
i	3921
said	3921
i	3921
must	3922
go	3922
and	3922
asked	3922
him	3922
to	3922
further	3922
me	3922
on	3922
my	3922
way	3922
he	3922
made	3922
no	3922
sort	3922
of	3922
difficulty	3923
but	3923
set	3923
about	3923
doing	3923
so	3923
at	3923
once	3923
moreover	3923
he	3923
flayed	3923
me	3923
a	3924
prime	3924
ox-hide	3924
to	3924
hold	3924
the	3924
ways	3924
of	3924
the	3924
roaring	3924
winds	3924
which	3924
he	3924
shut	3924
up	3925
in	3925
the	3925
hide	3925
as	3925
in	3925
a	3925
sack	3925
for	3925
jove	3925
had	3925
made	3925
him	3925
captain	3925
over	3925
the	3925
winds	3926
and	3926
he	3926
could	3926
stir	3926
or	3926
still	3926
each	3926
one	3926
of	3926
them	3926
according	3926
to	3926
his	3926
own	3927
pleasure	3927
he	3927
put	3927
the	3927
sack	3927
in	3927
the	3927
ship	3927
and	3927
bound	3927
the	3927
mouth	3927
so	3927
tightly	3927
with	3928
a	3928
silver	3928
thread	3928
that	3928
not	3928
even	3928
a	3928
breath	3928
of	3928
a	3928
side-wind	3928
could	3928
blow	3928
from	3929
any	3929
quarter	3929
the	3929
west	3929
wind	3929
which	3929
was	3929
fair	3929
for	3929
us	3929
did	3929
he	3929
alone	3929
let	3930
blow	3930
as	3930
it	3930
chose	3930
but	3930
it	3930
all	3930
came	3930
to	3930
nothing	3930
for	3930
we	3930
were	3930
lost	3930
through	3931
our	3931
own	3931
folly	3931
nine	3933
days	3933
and	3933
nine	3933
nights	3933
did	3933
we	3933
sail	3933
and	3933
on	3933
the	3933
tenth	3933
day	3933
our	3933
native	3933
land	3934
showed	3934
on	3934
the	3934
horizon	3934
we	3934
got	3934
so	3934
close	3934
in	3934
that	3934
we	3934
could	3934
see	3934
the	3934
stubble	3935
fires	3935
burning	3935
and	3935
i	3935
being	3935
then	3935
dead	3935
beat	3935
fell	3935
into	3935
a	3935
light	3935
sleep	3936
for	3936
i	3936
had	3936
never	3936
let	3936
the	3936
rudder	3936
out	3936
of	3936
my	3936
own	3936
hands	3936
that	3936
we	3936
might	3937
get	3937
home	3937
the	3937
faster	3937
on	3937
this	3937
the	3937
men	3937
fell	3937
to	3937
talking	3937
among	3937
themselves	3937
and	3938
said	3938
i	3938
was	3938
bringing	3938
back	3938
gold	3938
and	3938
silver	3938
in	3938
the	3938
sack	3938
that	3938
aeolus	3938
had	3939
given	3939
me	3939
bless	3939
my	3939
heart	3939
would	3939
one	3939
turn	3939
to	3939
his	3939
neighbour	3939
saying	3939
how	3940
this	3940
man	3940
gets	3940
honoured	3940
and	3940
makes	3940
friends	3940
to	3940
whatever	3940
city	3940
or	3940
country	3941
he	3941
may	3941
go	3941
see	3941
what	3941
fine	3941
prizes	3941
he	3941
is	3941
taking	3941
home	3941
from	3941
troy	3941
while	3942
we	3942
who	3942
have	3942
travelled	3942
just	3942
as	3942
far	3942
as	3942
he	3942
has	3942
come	3942
back	3942
with	3942
hands	3943
as	3943
empty	3943
as	3943
we	3943
set	3943
out	3943
with	3943
and	3943
now	3943
aeolus	3943
has	3943
given	3943
him	3943
ever	3943
so	3944
much	3944
more	3944
quick	3944
let	3944
us	3944
see	3944
what	3944
it	3944
all	3944
is	3944
and	3944
how	3944
much	3944
gold	3944
and	3945
silver	3945
there	3945
is	3945
in	3945
the	3945
sack	3945
he	3945
gave	3945
him	3945
thus	3947
they	3947
talked	3947
and	3947
evil	3947
counsels	3947
prevailed	3947
they	3947
loosed	3947
the	3947
sack	3947
whereupon	3948
the	3948
wind	3948
flew	3948
howling	3948
forth	3948
and	3948
raised	3948
a	3948
storm	3948
that	3948
carried	3948
us	3949
weeping	3949
out	3949
to	3949
sea	3949
and	3949
away	3949
from	3949
our	3949
own	3949
country	3949
then	3949
i	3949
awoke	3949
and	3950
knew	3950
not	3950
whether	3950
to	3950
throw	3950
myself	3950
into	3950
the	3950
sea	3950
or	3950
to	3950
live	3950
on	3950
and	3950
make	3951
the	3951
best	3951
of	3951
it	3951
but	3951
i	3951
bore	3951
it	3951
covered	3951
myself	3951
up	3951
and	3951
lay	3951
down	3951
in	3952
the	3952
ship	3952
while	3952
the	3952
men	3952
lamented	3952
bitterly	3952
as	3952
the	3952
fierce	3952
winds	3952
bore	3952
our	3953
fleet	3953
back	3953
to	3953
the	3953
aeolian	3953
island	3953
when	3955
we	3955
reached	3955
it	3955
we	3955
went	3955
ashore	3955
to	3955
take	3955
in	3955
water	3955
and	3955
dined	3955
hard	3955
by	3956
the	3956
ships	3956
immediately	3956
after	3956
dinner	3956
i	3956
took	3956
a	3956
herald	3956
and	3956
one	3956
of	3956
my	3957
men	3957
and	3957
went	3957
straight	3957
to	3957
the	3957
house	3957
of	3957
aeolus	3957
where	3957
i	3957
found	3957
him	3957
feasting	3958
with	3958
his	3958
wife	3958
and	3958
family	3958
so	3958
we	3958
sat	3958
down	3958
as	3958
suppliants	3958
on	3958
the	3959
threshold	3959
they	3959
were	3959
astounded	3959
when	3959
they	3959
saw	3959
us	3959
and	3959
said	3959
ulysses	3959
what	3960
brings	3960
you	3960
here	3960
what	3960
god	3960
has	3960
been	3960
ill-treating	3960
you	3960
we	3960
took	3960
great	3961
pains	3961
to	3961
further	3961
you	3961
on	3961
your	3961
way	3961
home	3961
to	3961
ithaca	3961
or	3961
wherever	3961
it	3962
was	3962
that	3962
you	3962
wanted	3962
to	3962
go	3962
to	3962
thus	3964
did	3964
they	3964
speak	3964
but	3964
i	3964
answered	3964
sorrowfully	3964
my	3964
men	3964
have	3964
undone	3964
me	3965
they	3965
and	3965
cruel	3965
sleep	3965
have	3965
ruined	3965
me	3965
my	3965
friends	3965
mend	3965
me	3965
this	3965
mischief	3966
for	3966
you	3966
can	3966
if	3966
you	3966
will	3966
i	3968
spoke	3968
as	3968
movingly	3968
as	3968
i	3968
could	3968
but	3968
they	3968
said	3968
nothing	3968
till	3968
their	3968
father	3969
answered	3969
vilest	3969
of	3969
mankind	3969
get	3969
you	3969
gone	3969
at	3969
once	3969
out	3969
of	3969
the	3969
island	3970
him	3970
whom	3970
heaven	3970
hates	3970
will	3970
i	3970
in	3970
no	3970
wise	3970
help	3970
be	3970
off	3970
for	3970
you	3971
come	3971
here	3971
as	3971
one	3971
abhorred	3971
of	3971
heaven	3971
and	3971
with	3971
these	3971
words	3971
he	3971
sent	3972
me	3972
sorrowing	3972
from	3972
his	3972
door	3972
thence	3974
we	3974
sailed	3974
sadly	3974
on	3974
till	3974
the	3974
men	3974
were	3974
worn	3974
out	3974
with	3974
long	3974
and	3974
fruitless	3975
rowing	3975
for	3975
there	3975
was	3975
no	3975
longer	3975
any	3975
wind	3975
to	3975
help	3975
them	3975
six	3975
days	3976
night	3976
and	3976
day	3976
did	3976
we	3976
toil	3976
and	3976
on	3976
the	3976
seventh	3976
day	3976
we	3976
reached	3976
the	3977
rocky	3977
stronghold	3977
of	3977
lamus	3977
telepylus	3977
the	3977
city	3977
of	3977
the	3977
laestrygonians	3977
where	3978
the	3978
shepherd	3978
who	3978
is	3978
driving	3978
in	3978
his	3978
sheep	3978
and	3978
goats	3978
to	3978
be	3978
milked	3978
salutes	3979
him	3979
who	3979
is	3979
driving	3979
out	3979
his	3979
flock	3979
to	3979
feed	3979
and	3979
this	3979
last	3979
answers	3979
the	3980
salute	3980
in	3980
that	3980
country	3980
a	3980
man	3980
who	3980
could	3980
do	3980
without	3980
sleep	3980
might	3980
earn	3981
double	3981
wages	3981
one	3981
as	3981
a	3981
herdsman	3981
of	3981
cattle	3981
and	3981
another	3981
as	3981
a	3981
shepherd	3981
for	3982
they	3982
work	3982
much	3982
the	3982
same	3982
by	3982
night	3982
as	3982
they	3982
do	3982
by	3982
day	3982
when	3984
we	3984
reached	3984
the	3984
harbour	3984
we	3984
found	3984
it	3984
land-locked	3984
under	3984
steep	3984
cliffs	3984
with	3985
a	3985
narrow	3985
entrance	3985
between	3985
two	3985
headlands	3985
my	3985
captains	3985
took	3985
all	3985
their	3986
ships	3986
inside	3986
and	3986
made	3986
them	3986
fast	3986
close	3986
to	3986
one	3986
another	3986
for	3986
there	3986
was	3987
never	3987
so	3987
much	3987
as	3987
a	3987
breath	3987
of	3987
wind	3987
inside	3987
but	3987
it	3987
was	3987
always	3987
dead	3987
calm	3988
i	3988
kept	3988
my	3988
own	3988
ship	3988
outside	3988
and	3988
moored	3988
it	3988
to	3988
a	3988
rock	3988
at	3988
the	3988
very	3988
end	3989
of	3989
the	3989
point	3989
then	3989
i	3989
climbed	3989
a	3989
high	3989
rock	3989
to	3989
reconnoitre	3989
but	3989
could	3989
see	3990
no	3990
sign	3990
neither	3990
of	3990
man	3990
nor	3990
cattle	3990
only	3990
some	3990
smoke	3990
rising	3990
from	3990
the	3991
ground	3991
so	3991
i	3991
sent	3991
two	3991
of	3991
my	3991
company	3991
with	3991
an	3991
attendant	3991
to	3991
find	3991
out	3992
what	3992
sort	3992
of	3992
people	3992
the	3992
inhabitants	3992
were	3992
the	3994
men	3994
when	3994
they	3994
got	3994
on	3994
shore	3994
followed	3994
a	3994
level	3994
road	3994
by	3994
which	3994
the	3994
people	3995
draw	3995
their	3995
firewood	3995
from	3995
the	3995
mountains	3995
into	3995
the	3995
town	3995
till	3995
presently	3996
they	3996
met	3996
a	3996
young	3996
woman	3996
who	3996
had	3996
come	3996
outside	3996
to	3996
fetch	3996
water	3996
and	3997
who	3997
was	3997
daughter	3997
to	3997
a	3997
laestrygonian	3997
named	3997
antiphates	3997
she	3997
was	3997
going	3998
to	3998
the	3998
fountain	3998
artacia	3998
from	3998
which	3998
the	3998
people	3998
bring	3998
in	3998
their	3998
water	3999
and	3999
when	3999
my	3999
men	3999
had	3999
come	3999
close	3999
up	3999
to	3999
her	3999
they	3999
asked	3999
her	3999
who	3999
the	4000
king	4000
of	4000
that	4000
country	4000
might	4000
be	4000
and	4000
over	4000
what	4000
kind	4000
of	4000
people	4000
he	4000
ruled	4001
so	4001
she	4001
directed	4001
them	4001
to	4001
her	4001
father's	4001
house	4001
but	4001
when	4001
they	4001
got	4001
there	4002
they	4002
found	4002
his	4002
wife	4002
to	4002
be	4002
a	4002
giantess	4002
as	4002
huge	4002
as	4002
a	4002
mountain	4002
and	4003
they	4003
were	4003
horrified	4003
at	4003
the	4003
sight	4003
of	4003
her	4003
she	4005
at	4005
once	4005
called	4005
her	4005
husband	4005
antiphates	4005
from	4005
the	4005
place	4005
of	4005
assembly	4005
and	4006
forthwith	4006
he	4006
set	4006
about	4006
killing	4006
my	4006
men	4006
he	4006
snatched	4006
up	4006
one	4006
of	4006
them	4006
and	4007
began	4007
to	4007
make	4007
his	4007
dinner	4007
off	4007
him	4007
then	4007
and	4007
there	4007
whereon	4007
the	4007
other	4007
two	4008
ran	4008
back	4008
to	4008
the	4008
ships	4008
as	4008
fast	4008
as	4008
ever	4008
they	4008
could	4008
but	4008
antiphates	4008
raised	4009
a	4009
hue	4009
and	4009
cry	4009
after	4009
them	4009
and	4009
thousands	4009
of	4009
sturdy	4009
laestrygonians	4009
sprang	4010
up	4010
from	4010
every	4010
quarter	4010
ogres	4010
not	4010
men	4010
they	4010
threw	4010
vast	4010
rocks	4010
at	4011
us	4011
from	4011
the	4011
cliffs	4011
as	4011
though	4011
they	4011
had	4011
been	4011
mere	4011
stones	4011
and	4011
i	4011
heard	4011
the	4012
horrid	4012
sound	4012
of	4012
the	4012
ships	4012
crunching	4012
up	4012
against	4012
one	4012
another	4012
and	4012
the	4013
death	4013
cries	4013
of	4013
my	4013
men	4013
as	4013
the	4013
laestrygonians	4013
speared	4013
them	4013
like	4013
fishes	4014
and	4014
took	4014
them	4014
home	4014
to	4014
eat	4014
them	4014
while	4014
they	4014
were	4014
thus	4014
killing	4014
my	4015
men	4015
within	4015
the	4015
harbour	4015
i	4015
drew	4015
my	4015
sword	4015
cut	4015
the	4015
cable	4015
of	4015
my	4015
own	4015
ship	4016
and	4016
told	4016
my	4016
men	4016
to	4016
row	4016
with	4016
alf	4016
their	4016
might	4016
if	4016
they	4016
too	4016
would	4016
not	4017
fare	4017
like	4017
the	4017
rest	4017
so	4017
they	4017
laid	4017
out	4017
for	4017
their	4017
lives	4017
and	4017
we	4017
were	4017
thankful	4018
enough	4018
when	4018
we	4018
got	4018
into	4018
open	4018
water	4018
out	4018
of	4018
reach	4018
of	4018
the	4018
rocks	4018
they	4019
hurled	4019
at	4019
us	4019
as	4019
for	4019
the	4019
others	4019
there	4019
was	4019
not	4019
one	4019
of	4019
them	4019
left	4019
thence	4021
we	4021
sailed	4021
sadly	4021
on	4021
glad	4021
to	4021
have	4021
escaped	4021
death	4021
though	4021
we	4021
had	4022
lost	4022
our	4022
comrades	4022
and	4022
came	4022
to	4022
the	4022
aeaean	4022
island	4022
where	4022
circe	4022
lives	4023
a	4023
great	4023
and	4023
cunning	4023
goddess	4023
who	4023
is	4023
own	4023
sister	4023
to	4023
the	4023
magician	4023
aeetes	4024
for	4024
they	4024
are	4024
both	4024
children	4024
of	4024
the	4024
sun	4024
by	4024
perse	4024
who	4024
is	4024
daughter	4024
to	4025
oceanus	4025
we	4025
brought	4025
our	4025
ship	4025
into	4025
a	4025
safe	4025
harbour	4025
without	4025
a	4025
word	4025
for	4026
some	4026
god	4026
guided	4026
us	4026
thither	4026
and	4026
having	4026
landed	4026
we	4026
there	4026
for	4026
two	4026
days	4027
and	4027
two	4027
nights	4027
worn	4027
out	4027
in	4027
body	4027
and	4027
mind	4027
when	4027
the	4027
morning	4027
of	4027
the	4028
third	4028
day	4028
came	4028
i	4028
took	4028
my	4028
spear	4028
and	4028
my	4028
sword	4028
and	4028
went	4028
away	4028
from	4028
the	4029
ship	4029
to	4029
reconnoitre	4029
and	4029
see	4029
if	4029
i	4029
could	4029
discover	4029
signs	4029
of	4029
human	4029
handiwork	4030
or	4030
hear	4030
the	4030
sound	4030
of	4030
voices	4030
climbing	4030
to	4030
the	4030
top	4030
of	4030
a	4030
high	4030
look-out	4031
i	4031
espied	4031
the	4031
smoke	4031
of	4031
circe's	4031
house	4031
rising	4031
upwards	4031
amid	4031
a	4031
dense	4032
forest	4032
of	4032
trees	4032
and	4032
when	4032
i	4032
saw	4032
this	4032
i	4032
doubted	4032
whether	4032
having	4032
seen	4033
the	4033
smoke	4033
i	4033
would	4033
not	4033
go	4033
on	4033
at	4033
once	4033
and	4033
find	4033
out	4033
more	4033
but	4033
in	4033
the	4034
end	4034
i	4034
deemed	4034
it	4034
best	4034
to	4034
go	4034
back	4034
to	4034
the	4034
ship	4034
give	4034
the	4034
men	4034
their	4034
dinners	4035
and	4035
send	4035
some	4035
of	4035
them	4035
instead	4035
of	4035
going	4035
myself	4035
when	4037
i	4037
had	4037
nearly	4037
got	4037
back	4037
to	4037
the	4037
ship	4037
some	4037
god	4037
took	4037
pity	4037
upon	4037
my	4037
solitude	4038
and	4038
sent	4038
a	4038
fine	4038
antlered	4038
stag	4038
right	4038
into	4038
the	4038
middle	4038
of	4038
my	4038
path	4039
he	4039
was	4039
coming	4039
down	4039
his	4039
pasture	4039
in	4039
the	4039
forest	4039
to	4039
drink	4039
of	4039
the	4039
river	4040
for	4040
the	4040
heat	4040
of	4040
the	4040
sun	4040
drove	4040
him	4040
and	4040
as	4040
he	4040
passed	4040
i	4040
struck	4040
him	4041
in	4041
the	4041
middle	4041
of	4041
the	4041
back	4041
the	4041
bronze	4041
point	4041
of	4041
the	4041
spear	4041
went	4041
clean	4042
through	4042
him	4042
and	4042
he	4042
lay	4042
groaning	4042
in	4042
the	4042
dust	4042
until	4042
the	4042
life	4042
went	4043
out	4043
of	4043
him	4043
then	4043
i	4043
set	4043
my	4043
foot	4043
upon	4043
him	4043
drew	4043
my	4043
spear	4043
from	4043
the	4043
wound	4044
and	4044
laid	4044
it	4044
down	4044
i	4044
also	4044
gathered	4044
rough	4044
grass	4044
and	4044
rushes	4044
and	4044
twisted	4045
them	4045
into	4045
a	4045
fathom	4045
or	4045
so	4045
of	4045
good	4045
stout	4045
rope	4045
with	4045
which	4045
i	4045
bound	4046
the	4046
four	4046
feet	4046
of	4046
the	4046
noble	4046
creature	4046
together	4046
having	4046
so	4046
done	4046
i	4047
hung	4047
him	4047
round	4047
my	4047
neck	4047
and	4047
walked	4047
back	4047
to	4047
the	4047
ship	4047
leaning	4047
upon	4047
my	4048
spear	4048
for	4048
the	4048
stag	4048
was	4048
much	4048
too	4048
big	4048
for	4048
me	4048
to	4048
be	4048
able	4048
to	4048
carry	4048
him	4049
on	4049
my	4049
shoulder	4049
steadying	4049
him	4049
with	4049
one	4049
hand	4049
as	4049
i	4049
threw	4049
him	4049
down	4049
in	4050
front	4050
of	4050
the	4050
ship	4050
i	4050
called	4050
the	4050
men	4050
and	4050
spoke	4050
cheeringly	4050
man	4050
by	4050
man	4051
to	4051
each	4051
of	4051
them	4051
look	4051
here	4051
my	4051
friends	4051
said	4051
i	4051
we	4051
are	4051
not	4051
going	4051
to	4052
die	4052
so	4052
much	4052
before	4052
our	4052
time	4052
after	4052
all	4052
and	4052
at	4052
any	4052
rate	4052
we	4052
will	4052
not	4053
starve	4053
so	4053
long	4053
as	4053
we	4053
have	4053
got	4053
something	4053
to	4053
eat	4053
and	4053
drink	4053
on	4053
board	4053
on	4054
this	4054
they	4054
uncovered	4054
their	4054
heads	4054
upon	4054
the	4054
sea	4054
shore	4054
and	4054
admired	4054
the	4055
stag	4055
for	4055
he	4055
was	4055
indeed	4055
a	4055
splendid	4055
fellow	4055
then	4055
when	4055
they	4055
had	4055
feasted	4056
their	4056
eyes	4056
upon	4056
him	4056
sufficiently	4056
they	4056
washed	4056
their	4056
hands	4056
and	4057
began	4057
to	4057
cook	4057
him	4057
for	4057
dinner	4057
thus	4059
through	4059
the	4059
livelong	4059
day	4059
to	4059
the	4059
going	4059
down	4059
of	4059
the	4059
sun	4059
we	4059
stayed	4059
there	4060
eating	4060
and	4060
drinking	4060
our	4060
fill	4060
but	4060
when	4060
the	4060
sun	4060
went	4060
down	4060
and	4060
it	4061
came	4061
on	4061
dark	4061
we	4061
camped	4061
upon	4061
the	4061
sea	4061
shore	4061
when	4061
the	4061
child	4061
of	4061
morning	4061
fingered	4062
dawn	4062
appeared	4062
i	4062
called	4062
a	4062
council	4062
and	4062
said	4062
my	4062
friends	4062
we	4063
are	4063
in	4063
very	4063
great	4063
difficulties	4063
listen	4063
therefore	4063
to	4063
me	4063
we	4063
have	4063
no	4064
idea	4064
where	4064
the	4064
sun	4064
either	4064
sets	4064
or	4064
rises	4064
so	4064
that	4064
we	4064
do	4064
not	4064
even	4064
know	4065
east	4065
from	4065
west	4065
i	4065
see	4065
no	4065
way	4065
out	4065
of	4065
it	4065
nevertheless	4065
we	4065
must	4065
try	4066
and	4066
find	4066
one	4066
we	4066
are	4066
certainly	4066
on	4066
an	4066
island	4066
for	4066
i	4066
went	4066
as	4066
high	4066
as	4067
i	4067
could	4067
this	4067
morning	4067
and	4067
saw	4067
the	4067
sea	4067
reaching	4067
all	4067
round	4067
it	4067
to	4067
the	4068
horizon	4068
it	4068
lies	4068
low	4068
but	4068
towards	4068
the	4068
middle	4068
i	4068
saw	4068
smoke	4068
rising	4068
from	4069
out	4069
of	4069
a	4069
thick	4069
forest	4069
of	4069
trees	4069
their	4071
hearts	4071
sank	4071
as	4071
they	4071
heard	4071
me	4071
for	4071
they	4071
remembered	4071
how	4071
they	4071
had	4072
been	4072
treated	4072
by	4072
the	4072
laestrygonian	4072
antiphates	4072
and	4072
by	4072
the	4072
savage	4072
ogre	4073
polyphemus	4073
they	4073
wept	4073
bitterly	4073
in	4073
their	4073
dismay	4073
but	4073
there	4073
was	4073
nothing	4074
to	4074
be	4074
got	4074
by	4074
crying	4074
so	4074
i	4074
divided	4074
them	4074
into	4074
two	4074
companies	4074
and	4075
set	4075
a	4075
captain	4075
over	4075
each	4075
i	4075
gave	4075
one	4075
company	4075
to	4075
eurylochus	4075
while	4075
i	4076
took	4076
command	4076
of	4076
the	4076
other	4076
myself	4076
then	4076
we	4076
cast	4076
lots	4076
in	4076
a	4076
helmet	4076
and	4077
the	4077
lot	4077
fell	4077
upon	4077
eurylochus	4077
so	4077
he	4077
set	4077
out	4077
with	4077
his	4077
twenty-two	4077
men	4078
and	4078
they	4078
wept	4078
as	4078
also	4078
did	4078
we	4078
who	4078
were	4078
left	4078
behind	4078
when	4080
they	4080
reached	4080
circe's	4080
house	4080
they	4080
found	4080
it	4080
built	4080
of	4080
cut	4080
stones	4080
on	4081
a	4081
site	4081
that	4081
could	4081
be	4081
seen	4081
from	4081
far	4081
in	4081
the	4081
middle	4081
of	4081
the	4081
forest	4081
there	4082
were	4082
wild	4082
mountain	4082
wolves	4082
and	4082
lions	4082
prowling	4082
all	4082
round	4082
it	4082
poor	4082
bewitched	4083
creatures	4083
whom	4083
she	4083
had	4083
tamed	4083
by	4083
her	4083
enchantments	4083
and	4083
drugged	4083
into	4084
subjection	4084
they	4084
did	4084
not	4084
attack	4084
my	4084
men	4084
but	4084
wagged	4084
their	4084
great	4084
tails	4085
fawned	4085
upon	4085
them	4085
and	4085
rubbed	4085
their	4085
noses	4085
lovingly	4085
against	4085
them	4085
as	4086
hounds	4086
crowd	4086
round	4086
their	4086
master	4086
when	4086
they	4086
see	4086
him	4086
coming	4086
from	4086
dinner	4086
for	4087
they	4087
know	4087
he	4087
will	4087
bring	4087
them	4087
something	4087
even	4087
so	4087
did	4087
these	4087
wolves	4087
and	4088
lions	4088
with	4088
their	4088
great	4088
claws	4088
fawn	4088
upon	4088
my	4088
men	4088
but	4088
the	4088
men	4088
were	4088
terribly	4089
frightened	4089
at	4089
seeing	4089
such	4089
strange	4089
creatures	4089
presently	4089
they	4089
reached	4090
the	4090
gates	4090
of	4090
the	4090
goddess's	4090
house	4090
and	4090
as	4090
they	4090
stood	4090
there	4090
they	4091
could	4091
hear	4091
circe	4091
within	4091
singing	4091
most	4091
beautifully	4091
as	4091
she	4091
worked	4091
at	4092
her	4092
loom	4092
making	4092
a	4092
web	4092
so	4092
fine	4092
so	4092
soft	4092
and	4092
of	4092
such	4092
dazzling	4092
colours	4092
as	4093
no	4093
one	4093
but	4093
a	4093
goddess	4093
could	4093
weave	4093
on	4093
this	4093
polites	4093
whom	4093
i	4093
valued	4093
and	4094
trusted	4094
more	4094
than	4094
any	4094
other	4094
of	4094
my	4094
men	4094
said	4094
there	4094
is	4094
some	4094
one	4094
inside	4095
working	4095
at	4095
a	4095
loom	4095
and	4095
singing	4095
most	4095
beautifully	4095
the	4095
whole	4095
place	4095
resounds	4096
with	4096
it	4096
let	4096
us	4096
call	4096
her	4096
and	4096
see	4096
whether	4096
she	4096
is	4096
woman	4096
or	4096
goddess	4097
they	4099
called	4099
her	4099
and	4099
she	4099
came	4099
down	4099
unfastened	4099
the	4099
door	4099
and	4099
bade	4099
them	4100
enter	4100
they	4100
thinking	4100
no	4100
evil	4100
followed	4100
her	4100
all	4100
except	4100
eurylochus	4100
who	4101
suspected	4101
mischief	4101
and	4101
stayed	4101
outside	4101
when	4101
she	4101
had	4101
got	4101
them	4101
into	4101
her	4102
house	4102
she	4102
set	4102
them	4102
upon	4102
benches	4102
and	4102
seats	4102
and	4102
mixed	4102
them	4102
a	4102
mess	4102
with	4103
cheese	4103
honey	4103
meal	4103
and	4103
pramnian	4103
but	4103
she	4103
drugged	4103
it	4103
with	4103
wicked	4103
poisons	4104
to	4104
make	4104
them	4104
forget	4104
their	4104
homes	4104
and	4104
when	4104
they	4104
had	4104
drunk	4104
she	4104
turned	4105
them	4105
into	4105
pigs	4105
by	4105
a	4105
stroke	4105
of	4105
her	4105
wand	4105
and	4105
shut	4105
them	4105
up	4105
in	4105
her	4106
pigsties	4106
they	4106
were	4106
like	4106
pigs-head	4106
hair	4106
and	4106
all	4106
and	4106
they	4106
grunted	4106
just	4107
as	4107
pigs	4107
do	4107
but	4107
their	4107
senses	4107
were	4107
the	4107
same	4107
as	4107
before	4107
and	4107
they	4107
remembered	4108
everything	4108
thus	4110
then	4110
were	4110
they	4110
shut	4110
up	4110
squealing	4110
and	4110
circe	4110
threw	4110
them	4110
some	4110
acorns	4111
and	4111
beech	4111
masts	4111
such	4111
as	4111
pigs	4111
eat	4111
but	4111
eurylochus	4111
hurried	4111
back	4111
to	4112
tell	4112
me	4112
about	4112
the	4112
sad	4112
fate	4112
of	4112
our	4112
comrades	4112
he	4112
was	4112
so	4112
overcome	4112
with	4113
dismay	4113
that	4113
though	4113
he	4113
tried	4113
to	4113
speak	4113
he	4113
could	4113
find	4113
no	4113
words	4113
to	4113
do	4114
so	4114
his	4114
eyes	4114
filled	4114
with	4114
tears	4114
and	4114
he	4114
could	4114
only	4114
sob	4114
and	4114
sigh	4114
till	4115
at	4115
last	4115
we	4115
forced	4115
his	4115
story	4115
out	4115
of	4115
him	4115
and	4115
he	4115
told	4115
us	4115
what	4115
had	4115
happened	4116
to	4116
the	4116
others	4116
we	4118
went	4118
said	4118
he	4118
as	4118
you	4118
told	4118
us	4118
through	4118
the	4118
forest	4118
and	4118
in	4118
the	4118
middle	4119
of	4119
it	4119
there	4119
was	4119
a	4119
fine	4119
house	4119
built	4119
with	4119
cut	4119
stones	4119
in	4119
a	4119
place	4119
that	4120
could	4120
be	4120
seen	4120
from	4120
far	4120
there	4120
we	4120
found	4120
a	4120
woman	4120
or	4120
else	4120
she	4120
was	4120
a	4121
goddess	4121
working	4121
at	4121
her	4121
loom	4121
and	4121
singing	4121
sweetly	4121
so	4121
the	4121
men	4121
shouted	4121
to	4122
her	4122
and	4122
called	4122
her	4122
whereon	4122
she	4122
at	4122
once	4122
came	4122
down	4122
opened	4122
the	4122
door	4122
and	4123
invited	4123
us	4123
in	4123
the	4123
others	4123
did	4123
not	4123
suspect	4123
any	4123
mischief	4123
so	4123
they	4123
followed	4124
her	4124
into	4124
the	4124
house	4124
but	4124
i	4124
stayed	4124
where	4124
i	4124
was	4124
for	4124
i	4124
thought	4124
there	4125
might	4125
be	4125
some	4125
treachery	4125
from	4125
that	4125
moment	4125
i	4125
saw	4125
them	4125
no	4125
more	4125
for	4126
not	4126
one	4126
of	4126
them	4126
ever	4126
came	4126
out	4126
though	4126
i	4126
sat	4126
a	4126
long	4126
time	4126
watching	4126
for	4127
them	4127
then	4129
i	4129
took	4129
my	4129
sword	4129
of	4129
bronze	4129
and	4129
slung	4129
it	4129
over	4129
my	4129
shoulders	4129
i	4129
also	4130
took	4130
my	4130
bow	4130
and	4130
told	4130
eurylochus	4130
to	4130
come	4130
back	4130
with	4130
me	4130
and	4130
show	4130
me	4131
the	4131
way	4131
but	4131
he	4131
laid	4131
hold	4131
of	4131
me	4131
with	4131
both	4131
his	4131
hands	4131
and	4131
spoke	4131
piteously	4131
saying	4132
sir	4132
do	4132
not	4132
force	4132
me	4132
to	4132
go	4132
with	4132
you	4132
but	4132
let	4132
me	4132
stay	4132
here	4132
for	4133
i	4133
know	4133
you	4133
will	4133
not	4133
bring	4133
one	4133
of	4133
them	4133
back	4133
with	4133
you	4133
nor	4133
even	4133
return	4134
alive	4134
yourself	4134
let	4134
us	4134
rather	4134
see	4134
if	4134
we	4134
cannot	4134
escape	4134
at	4134
any	4134
rate	4135
with	4135
the	4135
few	4135
that	4135
are	4135
left	4135
us	4135
for	4135
we	4135
may	4135
still	4135
save	4135
our	4135
lives	4135
stay	4137
where	4137
you	4137
are	4137
then	4137
answered	4137
i	4137
eating	4137
and	4137
drinking	4137
at	4137
the	4137
ship	4138
but	4138
i	4138
must	4138
go	4138
for	4138
i	4138
am	4138
most	4138
urgently	4138
bound	4138
to	4138
do	4138
so	4138
with	4140
this	4140
i	4140
left	4140
the	4140
ship	4140
and	4140
went	4140
up	4140
inland	4140
when	4140
i	4140
got	4140
through	4140
the	4141
charmed	4141
grove	4141
and	4141
was	4141
near	4141
the	4141
great	4141
house	4141
of	4141
the	4141
enchantress	4141
circe	4142
i	4142
met	4142
mercury	4142
with	4142
his	4142
golden	4142
wand	4142
disguised	4142
as	4142
a	4142
young	4142
man	4142
in	4143
the	4143
hey-day	4143
of	4143
his	4143
youth	4143
and	4143
beauty	4143
with	4143
the	4143
down	4143
just	4143
coming	4143
upon	4143
his	4144
face	4144
he	4144
came	4144
up	4144
to	4144
me	4144
and	4144
took	4144
my	4144
hand	4144
within	4144
his	4144
own	4144
saying	4144
my	4145
poor	4145
unhappy	4145
man	4145
whither	4145
are	4145
you	4145
going	4145
over	4145
this	4145
mountain	4145
top	4145
alone	4146
and	4146
without	4146
knowing	4146
the	4146
way	4146
your	4146
men	4146
are	4146
shut	4146
up	4146
in	4146
circe's	4146
pigsties	4147
like	4147
so	4147
many	4147
wild	4147
boars	4147
in	4147
their	4147
lairs	4147
you	4147
surely	4147
do	4147
not	4147
fancy	4148
that	4148
you	4148
can	4148
set	4148
them	4148
free	4148
i	4148
can	4148
tell	4148
you	4148
that	4148
you	4148

stay	4149
there	4149
with	4149
the	4149
rest	4149
of	4149
them	4149

a	4152
talisman	4152
to	4152
you	4152

upon	4156

be	4157
able	4158
to	4158
charm	4158
you	4158
for	4158
the	4158
virtue	4158
of	4158

goings	4161
to	4161

take	4164
good	4164
care	4164

solemnly	4164
by	4165
all	4165
the	4165

unman	4166
you	4166
and	4166
make	4166
you	4167
fit	4167
for	4167
nothing	4167
as	4169
he	4169

like	4170
the	4170
root	4170
was	4170
black	4170
while	4170
the	4170
flower	4170
was	4170
as	4170
white	4170
as	4170
milk	4171
the	4171
gods	4171
call	4171
it	4171
moly	4171
and	4171
mortal	4171
men	4171
cannot	4171
uproot	4171
it	4171
but	4171
the	4172
gods	4172
can	4172
do	4172
whatever	4172
they	4172
like	4172
then	4174
mercury	4174
went	4174
back	4174
to	4174
high	4174
olympus	4174
passing	4174
over	4174
the	4174
wooded	4174
island	4174
but	4175
i	4175
fared	4175
onward	4175
to	4175
the	4175
house	4175
of	4175
circe	4175
and	4175
my	4175
heart	4175
was	4175
clouded	4175
with	4176
care	4176
as	4176
i	4176
walked	4176
along	4176
when	4176
i	4176
got	4176
to	4176
the	4176
gates	4176
i	4176
stood	4176
there	4176
and	4177
called	4177
the	4177
goddess	4177
and	4177
as	4177
soon	4177
as	4177
she	4177
heard	4177
me	4177
she	4177
came	4177
down	4177
opened	4178
the	4178
door	4178
and	4178
asked	4178
me	4178
to	4178
come	4178
in	4178
so	4178
i	4178
followed	4178
her	4178
much	4178
troubled	4179
in	4179
my	4179
mind	4179
she	4179
set	4179
me	4179
on	4179
a	4179
richly	4179
decorated	4179
seat	4179
inlaid	4179
with	4180
silver	4180
there	4180
was	4180
a	4180
footstool	4180
also	4180
under	4180
my	4180
feet	4180
and	4180
she	4180
mixed	4180
a	4181
mess	4181
in	4181
a	4181
golden	4181
goblet	4181
for	4181
me	4181
to	4181
drink	4181
but	4181
she	4181
drugged	4181
it	4181
for	4181
she	4182
meant	4182
me	4182
mischief	4182
when	4182
she	4182
had	4182
given	4182
it	4182
me	4182
and	4182
i	4182
had	4182
drunk	4182
it	4182
without	4183
its	4183
charming	4183
me	4183
she	4183
struck	4183
she	4183
struck	4183
me	4183
with	4183
her	4183
wand	4183
there	4184
now	4184
she	4184
cried	4184
be	4184
off	4184
to	4184
the	4184
pigsty	4184
and	4184
make	4184
your	4184
lair	4184
with	4185
the	4185
rest	4185
of	4185
them	4185
but	4187
i	4187
rushed	4187
at	4187
her	4187
with	4187
my	4187
sword	4187
drawn	4187
as	4187
though	4187
i	4187
would	4187
kill	4187
her	4187
whereon	4188
she	4188
fell	4188
with	4188
a	4188
loud	4188
scream	4188
clasped	4188
my	4188
knees	4188
and	4188
spoke	4188
piteously	4188
saying	4189
who	4189
and	4189
whence	4189
are	4189
you	4189
from	4189
what	4189
place	4189
and	4189
people	4189
have	4189
you	4189
come	4190
how	4190
can	4190
it	4190
be	4190
that	4190
my	4190
drugs	4190
have	4190
no	4190
power	4190
to	4190
charm	4190
you	4190
never	4190
yet	4191
was	4191
any	4191
man	4191
able	4191
to	4191
stand	4191
so	4191
much	4191
as	4191
a	4191
taste	4191
of	4191
the	4191
herb	4191
i	4191
gave	4191
you	4192
you	4192
must	4192
be	4192
spell-proof	4192
surely	4192
you	4192
can	4192
be	4192
none	4192
other	4192
than	4192
the	4192
bold	4193
hero	4193
ulysses	4193
who	4193
mercury	4193
always	4193
said	4193

some	4193
day	4193
with	4194

sword	4195
and	4195
let	4195
us	4195

that	4195
we	4195
may	4195
make	4195
friends	4195
and	4195
learn	4195
to	4196
trust	4196
each	4196
other	4196
and	4198
i	4198
answered	4198
circe	4198
how	4198
can	4198
you	4198
expect	4198
me	4198
to	4198
be	4198
friendly	4198
with	4198
you	4199
when	4199
you	4199

just	4199
been	4199
turning	4199
all	4199
my	4199
men	4199
into	4199
pigs	4199
and	4199
now	4199
that	4200

got	4200
me	4200

with	4241
her	4241

me	4247
each	4247
of	4247
them	4247
by	4247
the	4247
hand	4247
and	4247

for	4247
joy	4247
till	4247
the	4248
whole	4248
house	4248
was	4248
filled	4248
with	4248
the	4248
sound	4248
of	4248
their	4248
hullabalooing	4248
and	4249
circe	4249
herself	4249
was	4249
so	4249
sorry	4249
for	4249
them	4249
that	4249
she	4249
came	4249
up	4249
to	4249
me	4249

with	4253
your	4253
men	4253

went	4255
back	4255
to	4255
the	4255

shore	4255
and	4255
found	4255
the	4255

the	4256
ship	4256
weeping	4256
and	4256
wailing	4256
most	4256
piteously	4256

they	4256
saw	4256
me	4257
the	4257
silly	4257
blubbering	4257
fellows	4257
began	4257
frisking	4257
round	4257
me	4257
as	4257
calves	4257
break	4258
out	4258
and	4258
gambol	4258
round	4258
their	4258
mothers	4258

the	4259
homestead	4259
resounds	4260
with	4260
their	4260
lowing	4260
they	4260
seemed	4260
as	4260
glad	4260
to	4260
see	4260
me	4260
as	4260
though	4260
they	4261

about	4264
the	4264
fate	4264
of	4264
our	4264
comrades	4264
i	4266
spoke	4266
comfortingly	4266
to	4266
them	4266
and	4266
said	4266
we	4266
must	4266
draw	4266
our	4266
ship	4266
on	4266
to	4267
the	4267
land	4267
and	4267

the	4267
ship's	4267
gear	4267
with	4267
all	4267
our	4267

circe's	4268
house	4268
where	4269
you	4269

find	4269
your	4269
comrades	4269
eating	4269
and	4269
drinking	4269
in	4269
the	4269
midst	4269
of	4270
great	4270
abundance	4270
on	4272
this	4272
the	4272
men	4272
would	4272
have	4272
come	4272
with	4272
me	4272
at	4272
once	4272
but	4272
eurylochus	4272
tried	4272
to	4273
hold	4273
them	4273
back	4273
and	4273
said	4273
alas	4273
poor	4273
wretches	4273
that	4273
we	4273
are	4273
what	4273

become	4274
of	4274

not	4274
on	4274
your	4274
ruin	4274
by	4274
going	4274
to	4274
the	4274
house	4274
of	4274

will	4275
turn	4275
us	4275
all	4275
into	4275
pigs	4275
or	4275
wolves	4275
or	4275
lions	4275
and	4275
we	4275
shall	4275
have	4276
to	4276
keep	4276
guard	4276
over	4276
her	4276
house	4276
remember	4276
how	4276
the	4276
cyclops	4276
treated	4276
us	4277
when	4277
our	4277
comrades	4277
went	4277
inside	4277
his	4277
cave	4277
and	4277
ulysses	4277
with	4277
them	4277
it	4278
was	4278
all	4278
through	4278
his	4278
sheer	4278
folly	4278
that	4278
those	4278
men	4278
lost	4278
their	4278
lives	4278
when	4280
i	4280
heard	4280
him	4280
i	4280
was	4280
in	4280
two	4280
minds	4280
whether	4280
or	4280
no	4280
to	4280
draw	4280
the	4280
keen	4280
blade	4281
that	4281
hung	4281
by	4281
my	4281
sturdy	4281
thigh	4281
and	4281
cut	4281
his	4281
head	4281
off	4281
in	4281
spite	4281
of	4281
his	4282
being	4282
a	4282
near	4282
relation	4282
of	4282
my	4282
own	4282
but	4282
the	4282
men	4282
interceded	4282
for	4282
him	4282
and	4283
said	4283
sir	4283
if	4283
it	4283
may	4283
so	4283
be	4283
let	4283
this	4283
fellow	4283
stay	4283
here	4283
and	4283

eurylochus	4286
was	4286
not	4286
left	4286
behind	4286
after	4286
all	4287
but	4287
came	4287
on	4287
too	4287
for	4287
he	4287
was	4287
frightened	4287
by	4287
the	4287
severe	4287
reprimand	4287
that	4288
i	4288
had	4288
given	4288
him	4288
meanwhile	4290
circe	4290

given	4291
them	4291

we	4292
found	4292
them	4292
all	4292
comfortably	4292
at	4293
dinner	4293
in	4293
her	4293
house	4293
as	4293

as	4293
the	4293
men	4293
saw	4293
each	4293
other	4293
face	4293
to	4293
face	4294
and	4294
knew	4294
one	4294
another	4294
they	4294
wept	4294
for	4294
joy	4294
and	4294
cried	4294
aloud	4294
till	4294
the	4295
whole	4295
palace	4295
rang	4295
again	4295
thereon	4295
circe	4295

all	4297

how	4297
ill	4297
you	4297

fared	4298
among	4298
cruel	4298
savages	4298

the	4298
mainland	4298

bustling	4383
about	4383

roof	4385
and	4385
broke	4385
his	4385

broken-hearted	4393
as	4393
they	4393
heard	4393
me	4393
and	4393
threw	4393
themselves	4393
on	4394
the	4394
ground	4394
groaning	4394
and	4394
tearing	4394
their	4394
hair	4394
but	4394
they	4394
did	4394
not	4394
mend	4394
matters	4395
by	4395
crying	4395
when	4395
we	4395
reached	4395
the	4395
sea	4395
shore	4395
weeping	4395
and	4395
lamenting	4395
our	4396
fate	4396

the	4396
ewe	4396
and	4396
we	4396
made	4396
them	4396
fast	4396
hard	4397
by	4397
the	4397
ship	4397
she	4397
passed	4397
through	4397
the	4397
midst	4397
of	4397
us	4397
without	4397
our	4397

the	4398

got	4405
down	4405
to	4405
the	4405
sea	4405

into	4405
the	4406
water	4406
and	4406
got	4406
her	4406

took	4407
our	4407
places	4407

in	4407
great	4407
distress	4407
of	4407

a	4408
fair	4408
wind	4408
that	4408
blew	4408

keeping	4409
our	4409
sails	4409
all	4409
the	4409
time	4409
well	4410

whatever	4410

doing	4410
to	4410
the	4410
ship's	4410

time	4439
to	4439

prayers	4439
to	4439
hades	4439
and	4439
to	4439
proserpine	4439
but	4440
i	4440
sat	4440
where	4440
i	4440
was	4440
with	4440
my	4440
sword	4440
drawn	4440
and	4440
would	4440
not	4440
let	4440
the	4440
poor	4440
feckless	4441
ghosts	4441
come	4441
near	4441
the	4441
blood	4441
till	4441
teiresias	4441

have	4441
answered	4441
my	4442
questions	4442
the	4444
first	4444
ghost	4444
that	4444
came	4444
was	4444
that	4444
of	4444
my	4444
comrade	4444
elpenor	4444
for	4444
he	4444
had	4445
not	4445
yet	4445
been	4445
laid	4445
beneath	4445
the	4445
earth	4445
we	4445
had	4445
left	4445
his	4445
body	4445
unwaked	4445
and	4446
unburied	4446
in	4446
circe's	4446
house	4446
for	4446
we	4446
had	4446
had	4446
too	4446
much	4446
else	4446
to	4446
do	4446
i	4447
was	4447
very	4447
sorry	4447
for	4447
him	4447
and	4447
cried	4447
when	4447
i	4447
saw	4447
him	4447
elpenor	4447
said	4447
i	4448
how	4448
did	4448
you	4448
come	4448
down	4448
here	4448
into	4448
this	4448
gloom	4448
and	4448
darkness	4448
you	4448
have	4448
here	4449
on	4449
foot	4449
quicker	4449
than	4449
i	4449
have	4449
with	4449
my	4449
ship	4449
sir	4451
he	4451
answered	4451
with	4451
a	4451
groan	4451
it	4451
was	4451
all	4451
bad	4451
luck	4451
and	4451
my	4451

unspeakable	4452
drunkenness	4452
i	4452
was	4452
lying	4452
asleep	4452
on	4452
the	4452
top	4452
of	4452
circe's	4452
house	4453
and	4453
never	4453
thought	4453
of	4453
coming	4453
down	4453
again	4453
by	4453
the	4453
great	4453
staircase	4453
but	4454
fell	4454
right	4454
off	4454
the	4454
roof	4454
and	4454
broke	4454
my	4454
neck	4454
so	4454
my	4454
soul	4454
down	4454
to	4454
the	4455
house	4455
of	4455
hades	4455
and	4455
now	4455
i	4455
beseech	4455
you	4455
by	4455
all	4455
those	4455
whom	4455
you	4455

behind	4456
you	4456
though	4456
they	4456
are	4456
not	4456
here	4456
by	4456
your	4456
wife	4456
by	4456
the	4456
father	4456
who	4457

you	4457
up	4457
when	4457
you	4457
were	4457
a	4457
child	4457
and	4457
by	4457
telemachus	4457
who	4457

that	4458
when	4459
you	4459
leave	4459

again	4459
hold	4459
your	4459
ship	4459
for	4459
the	4459
aeaean	4459
island	4460

thence	4460
leaving	4460
me	4460
unwaked	4460
and	4460
unburied	4460
behind	4460
you	4460
or	4461
i	4461
may	4461
bring	4461
heaven's	4461
anger	4461
upon	4461
you	4461
but	4461
burn	4461
me	4461
with	4461
whatever	4461
armour	4462

build	4462
a	4462
barrow	4462
for	4462
me	4462
on	4462
the	4462
sea	4462
shore	4462
that	4462

days	4463
to	4463
come	4463
what	4463
a	4463
poor	4463
unlucky	4463
fellow	4463
i	4463
was	4463
and	4463

over	4464
my	4464
grave	4464
the	4464
oar	4464

used	4464
to	4464
row	4464
with	4464
when	4464
i	4464
was	4464
yet	4464
alive	4464
and	4464
with	4465
my	4465
messmates	4465
and	4465
i	4465
said	4465

will	4465
do	4465
all	4465
that	4465
you	4466
have	4466
asked	4466
of	4466
me	4466
thus	4468
then	4468
did	4468
we	4468
sit	4468
and	4468
hold	4468
sad	4468
talk	4468
with	4468
one	4468
another	4468
i	4468
on	4468
the	4468
one	4469
side	4469
of	4469
the	4469
trench	4469
with	4469
my	4469
sword	4469
held	4469
over	4469
the	4469
blood	4469
and	4469
the	4469
ghost	4470
of	4470
my	4470
comrade	4470
saying	4470
all	4470
this	4470
to	4470
me	4470
from	4470
the	4470
other	4470
side	4470
then	4470
came	4471
the	4471
ghost	4471
of	4471
my	4471
dead	4471
mother	4471
anticlea	4471

for	4472
troy	4472
and	4472
was	4472
moved	4472
to	4472
tears	4472
when	4473
i	4473
saw	4473
her	4473
but	4473
even	4473
so	4473
for	4473
all	4473
my	4473
sorrow	4473
i	4473
would	4473
not	4473
let	4473
her	4473
come	4474
near	4474
the	4474
blood	4474
till	4474
i	4474
had	4474
asked	4474
my	4474
questions	4474
of	4474
teiresias	4474
then	4476

also	4476
the	4476
ghost	4476
of	4476
theban	4476
teiresias	4476
with	4476
his	4476
golden	4476
sceptre	4476
in	4477
his	4477
hand	4477
he	4477
knew	4477
me	4477
and	4477
said	4477
ulysses	4477

and	4478
come	4478
down	4478
to	4478

from	4479
the	4479
trench	4479
and	4479

the	4480
blood	4480
and	4480
answer	4480
your	4480
questions	4480

whereon	4483

this	4487
hard	4487
for	4487
you	4487
i	4487
do	4487

that	4487
you	4487

more	4563
as	4563

grows	4564
older	4564
as	4564
for	4564
my	4564
own	4564
end	4564
it	4564
was	4564
in	4564
this	4564
wise	4564
heaven	4564
did	4564
not	4564
take	4565
me	4565
swiftly	4565
and	4565
painlessly	4565
in	4565
my	4565
own	4565
house	4565
nor	4565
was	4565
i	4565
attacked	4565
by	4566
any	4566
illness	4566
such	4566
as	4566
those	4566
that	4566
generally	4566
wear	4566
people	4566
out	4566
and	4566
kill	4566
them	4567
but	4567
my	4567
longing	4567
to	4567
know	4567
what	4567
you	4567
were	4567
doing	4567
and	4567
the	4567
force	4567
of	4567
my	4568
affection	4568
for	4568
you	4568
this	4568
it	4568
was	4568
that	4568
was	4568
the	4568
death	4568
of	4568
me	4568
then	4570
i	4570
tried	4570
to	4570
find	4570
some	4570
way	4570
of	4570
embracing	4570
my	4570
mother's	4570
ghost	4570
thrice	4570
i	4571
sprang	4571
towards	4571
her	4571
and	4571
tried	4571
to	4571
clasp	4571
her	4571
in	4571
my	4571
arms	4571
but	4571
each	4571
time	4571
she	4572
flitted	4572
from	4572
my	4572
embrace	4572
as	4572
it	4572
were	4572
a	4572
dream	4572
or	4572
phantom	4572
and	4572
being	4572
touched	4573
to	4573
the	4573
quick	4573
i	4573
said	4573
to	4573
her	4573
mother	4573
why	4573
do	4573
you	4573
not	4573
stay	4573
still	4573
when	4574
i	4574
would	4574
embrace	4574
you	4574
if	4574
we	4574
could	4574
throw	4574
our	4574
arms	4574
around	4574
one	4574
another	4574
we	4575
might	4575
find	4575
sad	4575
comfort	4575
in	4575
the	4575
sharing	4575
of	4575
our	4575
sorrows	4575
even	4575
in	4575
the	4575
house	4576
of	4576
hades	4576
does	4576
proserpine	4576
want	4576
to	4576
lay	4576
a	4576
still	4576
further	4576
load	4576
of	4576
grief	4577
upon	4577
me	4577
by	4577
mocking	4577
me	4577
with	4577
a	4577
phantom	4577
only	4577
my	4579
son	4579
she	4579
answered	4579
most	4579
ill-fated	4579
of	4579
all	4579
mankind	4579
it	4579
is	4579
not	4579
proserpine	4580
that	4580
is	4580
beguiling	4580
you	4580
but	4580
all	4580
people	4580
are	4580
like	4580
this	4580
when	4580
they	4581
are	4581
dead	4581
the	4581
sinews	4581
no	4581
longer	4581
hold	4581
the	4581
flesh	4581
and	4581
bones	4581
together	4581
these	4582
perish	4582
in	4582
the	4582
fierceness	4582
of	4582
consuming	4582
fire	4582
as	4582
soon	4582
as	4582
life	4582
has	4582
left	4583
the	4583
body	4583
and	4583
the	4583
soul	4583
flits	4583
away	4583
as	4583
though	4583
it	4583
were	4583
a	4583
dream	4583
now	4584
however	4584
go	4584
back	4584
to	4584
the	4584
light	4584
of	4584
day	4584
as	4584
soon	4584
as	4584
you	4584
can	4584
and	4584
note	4585
all	4585
these	4585
things	4585
that	4585
you	4585
may	4585
tell	4585
them	4585
to	4585
your	4585
wife	4585
hereafter	4585
thus	4587
did	4587
we	4587
converse	4587
and	4587
anon	4587
proserpine	4587
sent	4587
up	4587
the	4587
ghosts	4587
of	4587
the	4587
wives	4588
and	4588
daughters	4588
of	4588
all	4588
the	4588
most	4588
famous	4588
men	4588
they	4588
gathered	4588
in	4588
crowds	4588
about	4589
the	4589
blood	4589
and	4589
i	4589
considered	4589
how	4589
i	4589
might	4589
question	4589
them	4589
severally	4589
in	4590
the	4590
end	4590
i	4590
deemed	4590
that	4590
it	4590
would	4590
be	4590
best	4590
to	4590
draw	4590
the	4590
keen	4590
blade	4590
that	4590
hung	4591
by	4591
my	4591
sturdy	4591
thigh	4591
and	4591
keep	4591
them	4591
from	4591
all	4591
drinking	4591
the	4591
blood	4591
at	4592
once	4592
so	4592
they	4592
came	4592
up	4592
one	4592
after	4592
the	4592
other	4592
and	4592
each	4592
one	4592
as	4592
i	4592
questioned	4592
her	4593
told	4593
me	4593
her	4593
race	4593
and	4593
lineage	4593
the	4595
first	4595
i	4595
saw	4595
was	4595
tyro	4595
she	4595
was	4595
daughter	4595
of	4595
salmoneus	4595
and	4595
wife	4595
of	4596
cretheus	4596
the	4596
son	4596
of	4596
aeolus	4596
she	4596
fell	4596
in	4596
love	4596
with	4596
the	4596
river	4596
enipeus	4596
who	4597
is	4597
much	4597
the	4597
most	4597
beautiful	4597
river	4597
in	4597
the	4597
whole	4597
world	4597
once	4597
when	4597
she	4598
was	4598
taking	4598
a	4598
walk	4598
by	4598
his	4598
side	4598
as	4598
usual	4598
neptune	4598
disguised	4598
as	4598
her	4599
lover	4599
lay	4599
with	4599
her	4599
at	4599
the	4599
mouth	4599
of	4599
the	4599
river	4599
and	4599
a	4599
huge	4599
blue	4599
wave	4600
arched	4600
itself	4600
like	4600
a	4600
mountain	4600
over	4600
them	4600
to	4600
hide	4600
both	4600
woman	4600
and	4600
god	4601
whereon	4601
he	4601
loosed	4601
her	4601
virgin	4601
girdle	4601
and	4601
laid	4601
her	4601
in	4601
a	4601
deep	4601
slumber	4601
when	4602
the	4602
god	4602
had	4602
accomplished	4602
the	4602
deed	4602
of	4602
love	4602
he	4602
took	4602
her	4602
hand	4602
in	4602
his	4603
own	4603
and	4603
said	4603
tyro	4603
rejoice	4603
in	4603
all	4603
good	4603
will	4603
the	4603
embraces	4603
of	4603
the	4604
gods	4604
are	4604
not	4604
fruitless	4604
and	4604
you	4604
will	4604
have	4604
fine	4604
twins	4604
about	4604
this	4604
time	4605
twelve	4605
months	4605
take	4605
great	4605
care	4605
of	4605
them	4605
i	4605
am	4605
neptune	4605
so	4605
now	4605
go	4606
home	4606
but	4606
hold	4606
your	4606
tongue	4606
and	4606
do	4606
not	4606
tell	4606
any	4606
one	4606
then	4608
he	4608
dived	4608
under	4608
the	4608
sea	4608
and	4608
she	4608
in	4608
due	4608
course	4608
bore	4608
pelias	4608

neleus	4609

tell	4708
such	4708
plausible	4708
stories	4708
that	4708
it	4708
is	4708
very	4708
hard	4708
to	4708
see	4709
through	4709
them	4709
but	4709
there	4709
is	4709
a	4709
style	4709
about	4709
your	4709
language	4709
which	4709
assures	4709
me	4710
of	4710
your	4710
good	4710
disposition	4710
moreover	4710
you	4710
have	4710
told	4710
the	4710
story	4710
of	4710
your	4710
own	4711
misfortunes	4711
and	4711
those	4711
of	4711
the	4711
argives	4711
as	4711
though	4711
you	4711
were	4711
a	4711
practised	4711
bard	4712
but	4712
tell	4712
me	4712
and	4712
tell	4712
me	4712
true	4712
whether	4712
you	4712
saw	4712
any	4712
of	4712
the	4712
mighty	4712
heroes	4713
who	4713
went	4713
to	4713
troy	4713
at	4713
the	4713
same	4713
time	4713
with	4713
yourself	4713
and	4713

therefore	4715
with	4715
your	4715
divine	4715
story	4715

a	4720
time	4720
for	4720
going	4720

nevertheless	4720
since	4720
you	4720

you	4721
the	4721
still	4721
sadder	4721
tale	4721
of	4721
those	4721
of	4721
my	4722
comrades	4722
who	4722
did	4722
not	4722
fall	4722
fighting	4722
with	4722
the	4722
trojans	4722
but	4722
perished	4722
on	4723
their	4723
return	4723
through	4723
the	4723
treachery	4723
of	4723
a	4723
wicked	4723
woman	4723
when	4725

with	4727
him	4727
in	4727
the	4727
house	4727

tasted	4728
the	4728

he	4728
knew	4728
me	4728

towards	4729
me	4729
to	4729

pitied	4730
him	4730

an	4733
end	4733
of	4733

on	4733

the	4739
death	4739

me	4740
and	4740
then	4740
butchered	4740
me	4741
most	4741
miserably	4741
as	4741

a	4741
fat	4741
beast	4741
in	4741
a	4741

some	4743
great	4743
nobleman	4744

men	4744
killed	4744
either	4744
in	4744
a	4744
general	4744

you	4745
never	4745
saw	4745
anything	4745
so	4745
truly	4745
pitiable	4746
as	4746
the	4746
way	4746
in	4746
which	4746
we	4746
fell	4746
in	4746
that	4746
cloister	4746
with	4746
the	4746
mixing-bowl	4746
and	4747
the	4747
loaded	4747
tables	4747
lying	4747
all	4747
about	4747

the	4747
ground	4747
reeking	4747
with	4747
our-blood	4748
i	4748
heard	4748
priam's	4748
daughter	4748
cassandra	4748
scream	4748
as	4748
clytemnestra	4748
killed	4749
her	4749
close	4749
beside	4749
me	4749
i	4749
lay	4749
dying	4749
upon	4749
the	4749
earth	4749
with	4749
the	4749
sword	4749
in	4750
my	4750
body	4750
and	4750
raised	4750
my	4750
hands	4750
to	4750
kill	4750
the	4750
slut	4750
of	4750
a	4750
murderess	4750
but	4750
she	4751
slipped	4751
away	4751
from	4751
me	4751
she	4751
would	4751
not	4751
even	4751
close	4751
my	4751
lips	4751
nor	4751
my	4751
eyes	4752
when	4752
i	4752
was	4752
dying	4752
for	4752
there	4752
is	4752
nothing	4752
in	4752
this	4752
world	4752
so	4752
cruel	4752
and	4753
so	4753
shameless	4753
as	4753
a	4753
woman	4753
when	4753
she	4753
has	4753
fallen	4753
into	4753
such	4753
guilt	4753
as	4753
hers	4754
was	4754
fancy	4754
murdering	4754
her	4754
own	4754
husband	4754
i	4754
thought	4754
i	4754
was	4754
going	4754
to	4754
be	4755
welcomed	4755
home	4755
by	4755
my	4755
children	4755
and	4755
my	4755
servants	4755
but	4755
her	4755
abominable	4755
crime	4756
has	4756
brought	4756
disgrace	4756
on	4756
herself	4756
and	4756
all	4756
women	4756
who	4756
shall	4756
come	4756
after	4757
even	4757
on	4757
the	4757
good	4757
ones	4757
and	4759
i	4759
said	4759
in	4759
truth	4759
jove	4759
has	4759
hated	4759
the	4759
house	4759
of	4759
atreus	4759
from	4759
first	4759
to	4760
last	4760
in	4760
the	4760
matter	4760
of	4760
their	4760
women's	4760
counsels	4760
see	4760
how	4760
many	4760
of	4760
us	4760
fell	4761
for	4761
helen's	4761
sake	4761
and	4761
now	4761
it	4761
seems	4761
that	4761
clytemnestra	4761
hatched	4761
mischief	4762
against	4762
too	4762
during	4762
your	4762
absence	4762

too	4764
friendly	4764
even	4765
with	4765
your	4765

all	4765
that	4765
you	4765
know	4765
perfectly	4765
well	4766
yourself	4766
tell	4766
her	4766
a	4766
part	4766
only	4766
and	4766
keep	4766
your	4766
own	4766
counsel	4766
about	4766
the	4767
rest	4767
not	4767
that	4767
your	4767
wife	4767
ulysses	4767
is	4767
likely	4767
to	4767
murder	4767

very	4768
admirable	4768
woman	4768

an	4768
excellent	4768
nature	4768

a	4769
young	4769
bride	4769
with	4769
an	4769
infant	4769
at	4769

breast	4769
when	4769

grown	4770
up	4770
happily	4770

he	4771

his	4771
father	4771
will	4771
have	4771
a	4771
joyful	4771
meeting	4771
and	4771
embrace	4771
one	4771
another	4771
as	4772
it	4772
is	4772
right	4772
they	4772
should	4772
do	4772
whereas	4772
my	4772
wicked	4772
wife	4772
did	4772
not	4772
even	4772
allow	4773
me	4773
the	4773
happiness	4773
of	4773
looking	4773
upon	4773
my	4773
son	4773

heard	4816
nothing	4816
i	4816

tell	4816
you	4816
all	4817
about	4817
your	4817
son	4817
neoptolemus	4817
for	4817

him	4817
in	4817
my	4817
own	4817
ship	4817
from	4817
scyros	4818
with	4818
the	4818
achaeans	4818
in	4818
our	4818
councils	4818
of	4818
war	4818
before	4818
troy	4818
he	4818
was	4818
always	4819
first	4819
to	4819
speak	4819
and	4819
his	4819
judgement	4819
was	4819
unerring	4819
nestor	4819
and	4819
i	4820
were	4820
the	4820
only	4820
two	4820
who	4820
could	4820
surpass	4820
him	4820
and	4820
when	4820
it	4820
came	4820
to	4820
fighting	4820
on	4821
the	4821
plain	4821
of	4821
troy	4821
he	4821
would	4821
never	4821
remain	4821
with	4821
the	4821
body	4821
of	4821
his	4821
men	4821
but	4822
would	4822
dash	4822
on	4822
far	4822
in	4822
front	4822
foremost	4822
of	4822
them	4822
all	4822
in	4822
valour	4822
many	4822
a	4823
man	4823
did	4823
he	4823
kill	4823
in	4823
battle	4823
i	4823
cannot	4823
name	4823
every	4823
single	4823
one	4823
of	4823
those	4823
whom	4824
he	4824
slew	4824

fighting	4824
on	4824
the	4824
side	4824
of	4824
the	4824
argives	4824
but	4824
will	4824
only	4824
say	4825
how	4825
he	4825
killed	4825
that	4825
valiant	4825
hero	4825
eurypylus	4825
son	4825
of	4825
telephus	4825
who	4825
was	4826
the	4826
handsomest	4826
man	4826
i	4826
ever	4826
saw	4826
except	4826
memnon	4826
many	4826
others	4826
also	4826
of	4827
the	4827
ceteians	4827
fell	4827
around	4827
him	4827
by	4827
reason	4827
of	4827
a	4827
woman's	4827
bribes	4827
moreover	4827
when	4828
all	4828
the	4828
bravest	4828
of	4828
the	4828
argives	4828
went	4828
inside	4828
the	4828
horse	4828
that	4828
epeus	4828
had	4829
made	4829
and	4829
it	4829
was	4829
left	4829
to	4829
me	4829
to	4829
settle	4829
when	4829
we	4829
should	4829
either	4829
open	4829
the	4830
door	4830
of	4830
our	4830
ambuscade	4830
or	4830
close	4830
it	4830
though	4830
all	4830
the	4830
other	4830
leaders	4830
and	4831
chief	4831
men	4831
among	4831
the	4831
danaans	4831
were	4831
drying	4831
their	4831
eyes	4831
and	4831
quaking	4831
in	4832
every	4832
limb	4832
i	4832
never	4832
once	4832
saw	4832
him	4832
turn	4832
pale	4832
nor	4832
wipe	4832
a	4832
tear	4832
from	4832
his	4833
cheek	4833
he	4833
was	4833
all	4833
the	4833
time	4833
urging	4833
me	4833
to	4833
break	4833
out	4833
from	4833
the	4833
horse	4833
grasping	4834
the	4834
handle	4834
of	4834
his	4834
sword	4834
and	4834
his	4834
bronze-shod	4834
spear	4834
and	4834
breathing	4834
fury	4835
against	4835
the	4835
foe	4835
yet	4835
when	4835
we	4835
had	4835
sacked	4835
the	4835
city	4835
of	4835
priam	4835
he	4835
got	4836
his	4836
handsome	4836
share	4836
of	4836
the	4836
prize	4836
money	4836
and	4836
went	4836
on	4836
board	4836
such	4836
is	4837
the	4837
fortune	4837
of	4837
war	4837
without	4837
a	4837
wound	4837
upon	4837
him	4837
neither	4837
from	4837
a	4837
thrown	4837
spear	4838
nor	4838
in	4838
close	4838
combat	4838
for	4838
the	4838
rage	4838
of	4838
mars	4838
is	4838
a	4838
matter	4838
of	4838
great	4838
chance	4839
when	4841
i	4841
had	4841
told	4841
him	4841
this	4841
the	4841
ghost	4841
of	4841
achilles	4841
strode	4841
off	4841
across	4841
a	4842
meadow	4842
full	4842
of	4842
asphodel	4842
exulting	4842
over	4842
what	4842
i	4842
had	4842
said	4842
concerning	4842
the	4843
prowess	4843
of	4843
his	4843
son	4843
the	4845
ghosts	4845
of	4845
other	4845
dead	4845
men	4845
stood	4845
near	4845
me	4845
and	4845
told	4845
me	4845
each	4845
his	4845
own	4845
melancholy	4846
tale	4846
but	4846
that	4846
of	4846
ajax	4846
son	4846
of	4846
telamon	4846
alone	4846
held	4846
aloof	4846
still	4847
angry	4847
with	4847
me	4847
for	4847
having	4847
won	4847
the	4847
cause	4847
in	4847
our	4847
dispute	4847
about	4847
the	4848
armour	4848
of	4848
achilles	4848
thetis	4848
had	4848
offered	4848
it	4848
as	4848
a	4848
prize	4848
but	4848
the	4848
trojan	4849
prisoners	4849
and	4849
minerva	4849
were	4849
the	4849
judges	4849
would	4849
that	4849
i	4849
had	4849
never	4849
gained	4850
the	4850
day	4850
in	4850
such	4850
a	4850
contest	4850
for	4850
it	4850
cost	4850
the	4850
life	4850
of	4850
ajax	4850
who	4850
was	4851
foremost	4851
of	4851
all	4851
the	4851
danaans	4851
after	4851
the	4851
son	4851
of	4851
peleus	4851
alike	4851
in	4851
stature	4852
and	4852
prowess	4852
when	4854
i	4854
saw	4854
him	4854
i	4854
tried	4854
to	4854
pacify	4854
him	4854
and	4854
said	4854
ajax	4854
will	4854
you	4854
not	4854
forget	4855
and	4855
forgive	4855
even	4855
in	4855
death	4855
but	4855
must	4855
the	4855
judgement	4855
about	4855
that	4855
hateful	4856
armour	4856
still	4856
rankle	4856
with	4856
you	4856
it	4856
cost	4856
us	4856
argives	4856
dear	4856
enough	4856
to	4857
lose	4857
such	4857
a	4857
tower	4857
of	4857
strength	4857
as	4857
you	4857
were	4857
to	4857
us	4857
we	4857
mourned	4857
you	4857
as	4858
much	4858
as	4858
we	4858
mourned	4858
achilles	4858
son	4858
of	4858
peleus	4858
himself	4858
nor	4858
can	4858
the	4858
blame	4859
be	4859
laid	4859
on	4859
anything	4859
but	4859
on	4859
the	4859
spite	4859
which	4859
jove	4859
bore	4859
against	4859
the	4860
danaans	4860
for	4860
it	4860
was	4860
this	4860
that	4860
made	4860
him	4860
counsel	4860
your	4860
destruction	4860
come	4861
hither	4861
therefore	4861
bring	4861
your	4861
proud	4861
spirit	4861
into	4861
subjection	4861
and	4861
hear	4862
what	4862
i	4862
can	4862
tell	4862
you	4862
he	4864
would	4864
not	4864
answer	4864
but	4864
turned	4864
away	4864
to	4864
erebus	4864
and	4864
to	4864
the	4864
other	4864
ghosts	4864
nevertheless	4865
i	4865
should	4865
have	4865
made	4865
him	4865
talk	4865
to	4865
me	4865
in	4865
spite	4865
of	4865
his	4865
being	4865
so	4866
angry	4866
or	4866
i	4866
should	4866
have	4866
gone	4866
talking	4866
to	4866
him	4866
only	4866
that	4866
there	4866
were	4866
still	4867
others	4867
among	4867
the	4867
dead	4867
whom	4867
i	4867
desired	4867
to	4867
see	4867
then	4869
i	4869
saw	4869
minos	4869
son	4869
of	4869
jove	4869
with	4869
his	4869
golden	4869
sceptre	4869
in	4869
his	4869
hand	4869
sitting	4870
in	4870
judgement	4870
on	4870
the	4870
dead	4870
and	4870
the	4870
ghosts	4870
were	4870
gathered	4870
sitting	4870
and	4871
standing	4871
round	4871
him	4871
in	4871
the	4871
spacious	4871
house	4871
of	4871
hades	4871
to	4871
learn	4871
his	4871
sentences	4872
upon	4872
them	4872
after	4874
him	4874
i	4874
saw	4874
huge	4874
orion	4874
in	4874
a	4874
meadow	4874
full	4874
of	4874
asphodel	4874
driving	4874
the	4874
ghosts	4875
of	4875
the	4875
wild	4875
beasts	4875
that	4875
he	4875
had	4875
killed	4875
upon	4875
the	4875
mountains	4875
and	4875
he	4876
had	4876
a	4876
great	4876
bronze	4876
club	4876
in	4876
his	4876
hand	4876
unbreakable	4876
for	4876
ever	4876
and	4876
ever	4876
and	4878
i	4878
saw	4878
tityus	4878
son	4878
of	4878
gaia	4878
stretched	4878
upon	4878
the	4878
plain	4878
and	4878
covering	4878
some	4879
nine	4879
acres	4879
of	4879
ground	4879
two	4879
vultures	4879
on	4879
either	4879
side	4879
of	4879
him	4879
were	4879
digging	4880
their	4880
beaks	4880
into	4880
his	4880
liver	4880
and	4880
he	4880
kept	4880
on	4880
trying	4880
to	4880
beat	4880
them	4881
off	4881
with	4881
his	4881
hands	4881
but	4881
could	4881
not	4881
for	4881
he	4881
had	4881
violated	4881
jove's	4881
mistress	4882
leto	4882
as	4882
she	4882
was	4882
going	4882
through	4882
panopeus	4882
on	4882
her	4882
way	4882
to	4882
pytho	4882
i	4884
saw	4884
also	4884
the	4884
dreadful	4884
fate	4884
of	4884
tantalus	4884
who	4884
stood	4884
in	4884
a	4884
lake	4884
that	4884
reached	4885
his	4885
chin	4885
he	4885
was	4885
dying	4885
to	4885
quench	4885
his	4885
thirst	4885
but	4885
could	4885
never	4885
reach	4886
the	4886
water	4886
for	4886
whenever	4886
the	4886
poor	4886
creature	4886
stooped	4886
to	4886
drink	4886
it	4887
dried	4887
up	4887
and	4887
vanished	4887
so	4887
that	4887
there	4887
was	4887
nothing	4887
but	4887
dry	4887
ground	4887
parched	4888
by	4888
the	4888
spite	4888
of	4888
heaven	4888
there	4888
were	4888
tall	4888
trees	4888
moreover	4888
that	4888
shed	4889
their	4889
fruit	4889
over	4889
his	4889
head	4889
pears	4889
pomegranates	4889
apples	4889
sweet	4889
figs	4890
and	4890
juicy	4890
olives	4890
but	4890
whenever	4890
the	4890
poor	4890
creature	4890
stretched	4890
out	4890
his	4891
hand	4891
to	4891
take	4891
some	4891
the	4891
wind	4891
tossed	4891
the	4891
branches	4891
back	4891
again	4891
to	4891
the	4892
clouds	4892
and	4894
i	4894
saw	4894
sisyphus	4894
at	4894
his	4894
endless	4894
task	4894
raising	4894
his	4894
prodigious	4894
stone	4894
with	4895
both	4895
his	4895
hands	4895
with	4895
hands	4895
and	4895
feet	4895
he	4895
tried	4895
to	4895
roll	4895
it	4895
up	4895
to	4895
the	4896
top	4896
of	4896
the	4896
hill	4896
but	4896
always	4896
just	4896
before	4896
he	4896
could	4896
roll	4896
it	4896
over	4896
on	4897
to	4897
the	4897
other	4897
side	4897
its	4897
weight	4897
would	4897
be	4897
too	4897
much	4897
for	4897
him	4897
and	4897
the	4897
pitiless	4898
stone	4898
would	4898
come	4898
thundering	4898
down	4898
again	4898
on	4898
to	4898
the	4898
plain	4898
then	4898
he	4899
would	4899
begin	4899
trying	4899
to	4899
push	4899
it	4899
up	4899
hill	4899
again	4899
and	4899
the	4899
sweat	4899
ran	4899
off	4900
him	4900
and	4900
the	4900
steam	4900
rose	4900
after	4900
him	4900
after	4902
him	4902
i	4902
saw	4902
mighty	4902
hercules	4902
but	4902
it	4902
was	4902
his	4902
phantom	4902
only	4902
for	4902
he	4903
is	4903
feasting	4903
ever	4903
with	4903
the	4903
immortal	4903
gods	4903
and	4903
has	4903
lovely	4903
hebe	4903
to	4903
wife	4904
who	4904
is	4904
daughter	4904
of	4904
jove	4904
and	4904
juno	4904
the	4904
ghosts	4904
were	4904
screaming	4904
round	4905
him	4905
like	4905
scared	4905
birds	4905
flying	4905
all	4905
whithers	4905
he	4905
looked	4905
black	4905
as	4905
night	4906
with	4906
his	4906
bare	4906
bow	4906
in	4906
his	4906
hands	4906
and	4906
his	4906
arrow	4906
on	4906
the	4906
string	4906
glaring	4907
around	4907
as	4907
though	4907
ever	4907
on	4907
the	4907
point	4907
of	4907
taking	4907
aim	4907
about	4907
his	4907
breast	4908
there	4908
was	4908
a	4908
wondrous	4908
golden	4908
belt	4908
adorned	4908
in	4908
the	4908
most	4908
marvellous	4908
fashion	4909
with	4909
bears	4909
wild	4909
boars	4909
and	4909
lions	4909
with	4909
gleaming	4909
eyes	4909
there	4909
was	4910
also	4910
war	4910
battle	4910
and	4910
death	4910
the	4910
man	4910
who	4910
made	4910
that	4910
belt	4910
do	4910
what	4910
he	4911
might	4911
would	4911
never	4911
be	4911
able	4911
to	4911
make	4911
another	4911
like	4911
it	4911
hercules	4911
knew	4911
me	4912
at	4912
once	4912
when	4912
he	4912
saw	4912
me	4912
and	4912
spoke	4912
piteously	4912
saying	4912
my	4912
poor	4912
ulysses	4912
noble	4913
son	4913
of	4913
laertes	4913
are	4913
you	4913
too	4913
leading	4913
the	4913
same	4913
sorry	4913
kind	4913
of	4913
life	4913
that	4914
i	4914
did	4914
when	4914
i	4914
was	4914
above	4914
ground	4914
i	4914
was	4914
son	4914
of	4914
jove	4914
but	4914
i	4914
went	4914
through	4915
an	4915
infinity	4915
of	4915
suffering	4915
for	4915
i	4915
became	4915
bondsman	4915
to	4915
one	4915
who	4915
was	4916
far	4916
beneath	4916
me	4916
a	4916
low	4916
fellow	4916
who	4916
set	4916
me	4916
all	4916
manner	4916
of	4916
labours	4916
he	4917
once	4917
sent	4917
me	4917
here	4917
to	4917
fetch	4917
the	4917
hell-hound	4917
for	4917
he	4917
did	4917
not	4917
think	4917
he	4918
could	4918
find	4918
anything	4918
harder	4918
for	4918
me	4918
than	4918
this	4918
but	4918
i	4918
got	4918
the	4918
hound	4918
out	4919
of	4919
hades	4919
and	4919
brought	4919
him	4919
to	4919
him	4919
for	4919
mercury	4919
and	4919
minerva	4919
helped	4919
me	4920
on	4922
this	4922
hercules	4922
went	4922
down	4922
again	4922
into	4922
the	4922
house	4922
of	4922
hades	4922
but	4922
i	4922
stayed	4922
where	4923
i	4923
was	4923
in	4923
case	4923
some	4923
other	4923
of	4923
the	4923
mighty	4923
dead	4923
should	4923
come	4923
to	4923
me	4923
and	4924
i	4924
should	4924
have	4924
seen	4924
still	4924
other	4924
of	4924
them	4924
that	4924
are	4924
gone	4924
before	4924
whom	4924
i	4925
would	4925
fain	4925
have	4925
seen	4925
theseus	4925
and	4925
pirithous	4925
glorious	4925
children	4925
of	4925
the	4926
gods	4926
but	4926
so	4926
many	4926
thousands	4926
of	4926
ghosts	4926
came	4926
round	4926
me	4926
and	4926
uttered	4926
such	4927
appalling	4927
cries	4927
that	4927
i	4927
was	4927
panic	4927
stricken	4927
lest	4927
proserpine	4927
should	4927
send	4928
up	4928
from	4928
the	4928
house	4928
of	4928
hades	4928
the	4928
head	4928
of	4928
that	4928
awful	4928
monster	4928
gorgon	4928
on	4929
this	4929
i	4929
hastened	4929
back	4929
to	4929
my	4929
ship	4929
and	4929
ordered	4929
my	4929
men	4929

board	4929
at	4930
once	4930

and	4930
took	4930
their	4930
places	4930
whereon	4931
the	4931
ship	4931
went	4931
down	4931
the	4931
stream	4931
of	4931
the	4931
river	4931
oceanus	4931
we	4931
had	4931
to	4932

at	4932

presently	4932
a	4932
fair	4932
wind	4932
sprang	4932
up	4932
book	4936

after	4938

were	4938
clear	4938

sunrise	4940
as	4940
in	4940
other	4940

then	4940
drew	4940
our	4940
ship	4940
on	4940
to	4940
the	4941
sands	4941
and	4941

her	4941
on	4941
to	4941
the	4941
shore	4941
where	4941
we	4941
went	4941
to	4941
sleep	4941
and	4942
waited	4942
till	4942
day	4942
should	4942
break	4942

when	4944
the	4944

to	4945
fetch	4945

cut	4945
firewood	4946
from	4946
a	4946
wood	4946
where	4946
the	4946
headland	4946
jutted	4946
out	4946
into	4946
the	4946
sea	4946

after	4947

wept	4947
over	4947

lamented	4947
him	4947
we	4947
performed	4947
his	4947

and	4948
armour	4948

burned	4948
to	4948

a	4949
stone	4949
over	4949
it	4949
and	4949
at	4949
the	4949
top	4949
of	4949
the	4949
cairn	4949
we	4949
fixed	4949
the	4950
oar	4950
that	4950

had	4950
been	4950
used	4950
to	4950

of	4955
us	4955
and	4955
said	4955
you	4955

a	4956
bold	4956
thing	4956

from	4961
misadventure	4961
either	4961
by	4961
land	4961
or	4961
sea	4961
we	4963
agreed	4963
to	4963
do	4963
as	4963
she	4963
had	4963
said	4963
and	4963
feasted	4963
through	4963
the	4963

to	4964
the	4964
going	4964
down	4964

set	4964
and	4964
it	4964
came	4965
on	4965
dark	4965
the	4965
men	4965
laid	4965
themselves	4965
down	4965
to	4965
sleep	4965
by	4965
the	4965
stern	4965
cables	4965
of	4966
the	4966
ship	4966
then	4966
circe	4966
took	4966
me	4966
by	4966
the	4966
hand	4966
and	4966
bade	4966
me	4966
be	4966
seated	4966
away	4967
from	4967
the	4967
others	4967
while	4967
she	4967
reclined	4967
by	4967
my	4967
side	4967
and	4967
asked	4967
me	4967
all	4967
about	4968
our	4968
adventures	4968
so	4970
far	4970
so	4970
good	4970
said	4970
she	4970
when	4970
i	4970
had	4970
ended	4970
my	4970
story	4970
and	4970
now	4970
pay	4970
attention	4971
to	4971
what	4971
i	4971
am	4971
about	4971
to	4971
tell	4971
you	4971
heaven	4971
itself	4971
indeed	4971
will	4971
recall	4972
it	4972
to	4972
your	4972
recollection	4972
first	4972
you	4972
will	4972
come	4972
to	4972
the	4972
sirens	4972
who	4973
enchant	4973
all	4973
who	4973
come	4973
near	4973
them	4973
if	4973
any	4973
one	4973
unwarily	4973
draws	4973
in	4973
too	4973
close	4974
and	4974
hears	4974
the	4974
singing	4974
of	4974
the	4974
sirens	4974
his	4974
wife	4974
and	4974
children	4974
will	4974
never	4975
welcome	4975
him	4975
home	4975
again	4975
for	4975
they	4975
sit	4975
in	4975
a	4975
green	4975
field	4975
and	4975
warble	4975
him	4976
to	4976
death	4976
with	4976
the	4976
sweetness	4976
of	4976
their	4976
song	4976
there	4976
is	4976
a	4976
great	4976
heap	4976
of	4977
dead	4977
men's	4977
bones	4977
lying	4977
all	4977
around	4977
with	4977
the	4977
flesh	4977
still	4977
rotting	4977
off	4978
them	4978
therefore	4978
pass	4978
these	4978

in	5011
truth	5011
she	5011

twelve	5013

six	5013

at	5014

out	5020
all	5020

here	5046
you	5046
will	5046
see	5046
many	5047

they	5049
become	5049
fewer	5049

done	5052
suckling	5052
them	5052
sent	5052
them	5052
to	5052
the	5052
thrinacian	5052
island	5053
which	5053
was	5053
a	5053
long	5053
way	5053
off	5053
to	5053
live	5053
there	5053
and	5053
look	5053
after	5053
their	5053
father's	5054
flocks	5054
and	5054
herds	5054
if	5054
you	5054
leave	5054
these	5054
flocks	5054
unharmed	5054
and	5054
think	5055
of	5055
nothing	5055
but	5055
getting	5055
home	5055
you	5055
may	5055
yet	5055
after	5055
much	5055
hardship	5055
reach	5056
ithaca	5056
but	5056
if	5056
you	5056
harm	5056
them	5056
then	5056
i	5056
forewarn	5056
you	5056
of	5056
the	5056
destruction	5056
both	5057
of	5057
your	5057
ship	5057

of	5057
your	5057

even	5057
though	5057
you	5057
may	5057
yourself	5057
escape	5058
you	5058
will	5058
return	5058
late	5058
in	5058
bad	5058
plight	5058
after	5058
losing	5058
all	5058
your	5058
men	5059
here	5061
she	5061
ended	5061
and	5061
dawn	5061
enthroned	5061
in	5061
gold	5061
began	5061
to	5061
show	5061
in	5061
heaven	5061
whereon	5062
she	5062
returned	5062
inland	5062
i	5062
then	5062
went	5062
on	5062
board	5062
and	5062
told	5062
my	5062
men	5062
to	5063
loose	5063
the	5063
ship	5063
from	5063
her	5063
moorings	5063
so	5063
they	5063
at	5063
once	5063
got	5063
into	5063
her	5063
took	5064
their	5064
places	5064
and	5064
began	5064
to	5064
smite	5064
the	5064
grey	5064
sea	5064
with	5064
their	5064
oars	5064
presently	5065
the	5065
great	5065
and	5065
cunning	5065
goddess	5065
circe	5065
befriended	5065
us	5065
with	5065
a	5065
fair	5066
wind	5066
that	5066
blew	5066
dead	5066
aft	5066
and	5066
stayed	5066
steadily	5066
with	5066
us	5066
keeping	5066
our	5067
sails	5067
well	5067
filled	5067
so	5067
we	5067
did	5067
whatever	5067
wanted	5067
doing	5067
to	5067
the	5067
ship's	5067
gear	5068
and	5068
let	5068
her	5068
go	5068
as	5068
wind	5068
and	5068
helmsman	5068
headed	5068
her	5068
then	5070
being	5070
much	5070
troubled	5070
in	5070
mind	5070
i	5070
said	5070
to	5070
my	5070
men	5070
my	5070
friends	5070
it	5071
is	5071
not	5071
right	5071
that	5071
one	5071
or	5071
two	5071
of	5071
us	5071
alone	5071
should	5071
know	5071
the	5071
prophecies	5071
that	5072
circe	5072
has	5072
made	5072
me	5072
i	5072
will	5072
therefore	5072
tell	5072
you	5072
about	5072
them	5072
so	5072
that	5072
whether	5073
we	5073
live	5073
or	5073
die	5073
we	5073
may	5073
do	5073
so	5073
with	5073
our	5073
eyes	5073
open	5073
first	5073
she	5073
said	5074
we	5074
were	5074
to	5074
keep	5074
clear	5074
of	5074
the	5074
sirens	5074
who	5074
sit	5074
and	5074
sing	5074
most	5074
beautifully	5074
in	5075
a	5075
field	5075
of	5075
flowers	5075
but	5075
she	5075
said	5075
i	5075
might	5075
hear	5075
them	5075
myself	5075
so	5075
long	5075
as	5076
no	5076
one	5076
else	5076
did	5076
therefore	5076
take	5076
me	5076
and	5076
bind	5076
me	5076
to	5076
the	5076
crosspiece	5076
half	5077
way	5077
up	5077
the	5077
mast	5077
bind	5077
me	5077
as	5077
i	5077
stand	5077
upright	5077
with	5077
a	5077
bond	5077
so	5077
fast	5077
that	5078
i	5078
cannot	5078
possibly	5078
break	5078
away	5078
and	5078
lash	5078
the	5078
rope's	5078
ends	5078
to	5078
the	5078
mast	5079
itself	5079
if	5079
i	5079
beg	5079
and	5079
pray	5079
you	5079
to	5079
set	5079
me	5079
free	5079
then	5079
bind	5079
me	5079
more	5079
tightly	5080
still	5080
i	5082
had	5082
hardly	5082
finished	5082
telling	5082
everything	5082
to	5082
the	5082
men	5082
before	5082
we	5082
reached	5082
the	5083
island	5083
of	5083
the	5083
two	5083
sirens	5083
for	5083
the	5083
wind	5083
had	5083
been	5083
very	5083
favourable	5083
then	5084
all	5084
of	5084
a	5084
sudden	5084
it	5084
fell	5084
dead	5084
calm	5084
there	5084
was	5084
not	5084
a	5084
breath	5084
of	5084
wind	5085
nor	5085
a	5085
ripple	5085
upon	5085
the	5085
water	5085
so	5085
the	5085
men	5085
furled	5085
the	5085
sails	5085
and	5085
stowed	5086
them	5086
then	5086
taking	5086
to	5086
their	5086
oars	5086
they	5086
whitened	5086
the	5086
water	5086
with	5086
the	5087
foam	5087
they	5087
raised	5087
in	5087
rowing	5087
meanwhile	5087
i	5087
look	5087
a	5087
large	5087
wheel	5087
of	5087
wax	5088
and	5088
cut	5088
it	5088
up	5088
small	5088
with	5088
my	5088
sword	5088
then	5088
i	5088
kneaded	5088
the	5088
wax	5088
in	5088
my	5088
strong	5089
hands	5089
till	5089
it	5089
became	5089
soft	5089
which	5089
it	5089
soon	5089
did	5089
between	5089
the	5089
kneading	5089
and	5090
the	5090
rays	5090
of	5090
the	5090
sun-god	5090
son	5090
of	5090
hyperion	5090
then	5090
i	5090
stopped	5090
the	5090
ears	5090
of	5091
all	5091
my	5091
men	5091
and	5091
they	5091
bound	5091
me	5091
hands	5091
and	5091
feet	5091
to	5091
the	5091
mast	5091
as	5091
i	5091
stood	5091
upright	5092
on	5092
the	5092
crosspiece	5092
but	5092
they	5092
went	5092
on	5092
rowing	5092
themselves	5092
when	5092
we	5093
had	5093
got	5093
within	5093
earshot	5093
of	5093
the	5093
land	5093
and	5093
the	5093
ship	5093
was	5093
going	5093
at	5093
a	5093
good	5094
rate	5094
the	5094
sirens	5094
saw	5094
that	5094
we	5094
were	5094
getting	5094
in	5094
shore	5094
and	5094
began	5094
with	5095
their	5095
singing	5095
come	5097
here	5097
they	5097
sang	5097
renowned	5097
ulysses	5097
honour	5097
to	5097
the	5097
achaean	5097
name	5098
and	5098
listen	5098
to	5098
our	5098
two	5098
voices	5098
no	5098
one	5098
ever	5098
sailed	5098
past	5098
us	5098
without	5098
staying	5099
to	5099
hear	5099
the	5099
enchanting	5099
sweetness	5099
of	5099
our	5099
song	5099
and	5099
he	5099
who	5099
listens	5099
will	5100
go	5100
on	5100
his	5100
way	5100
not	5100
only	5100
charmed	5100
but	5100
wiser	5100
for	5100
we	5100
know	5100
all	5100
the	5100
ills	5101
that	5101
the	5101
gods	5101
laid	5101
upon	5101
the	5101
argives	5101
and	5101
trojans	5101
before	5101
troy	5101
and	5102
can	5102
tell	5102
you	5102
everything	5102
that	5102
is	5102
going	5102
to	5102
happen	5102
over	5102
the	5102
whole	5102
world	5103
they	5105
sang	5105
these	5105
words	5105
most	5105
musically	5105
and	5105
as	5105
i	5105
longed	5105
to	5105
hear	5105
them	5105
further	5106
i	5106
made	5106
by	5106
frowning	5106
to	5106
my	5106
men	5106
that	5106
they	5106
should	5106
set	5106
me	5106
free	5106
but	5107
they	5107
quickened	5107
their	5107
stroke	5107
and	5107
eurylochus	5107
and	5107
perimedes	5107
bound	5107
me	5108
with	5108
still	5108
stronger	5108
bonds	5108
till	5108
we	5108
had	5108
got	5108
out	5108
of	5108
hearing	5108
of	5108
the	5108
sirens	5109
voices	5109
then	5109
my	5109
men	5109
took	5109
the	5109
wax	5109
from	5109
their	5109
ears	5109
and	5109
unbound	5109
me	5110
immediately	5112
after	5112
we	5112
had	5112
got	5112
past	5112
the	5112
island	5112
i	5112
saw	5112
a	5112
great	5112
wave	5112
from	5112
which	5113
spray	5113
was	5113
rising	5113
and	5113
i	5113
heard	5113
a	5113
loud	5113
roaring	5113
sound	5113
the	5113
men	5113
were	5114
so	5114
frightened	5114
that	5114
they	5114
loosed	5114
hold	5114
of	5114
their	5114
oars	5114
for	5114
the	5114
whole	5114
sea	5115
resounded	5115
with	5115
the	5115
rushing	5115
of	5115
the	5115
waters	5115
but	5115
the	5115
ship	5115
stayed	5115
where	5116
it	5116
was	5116
for	5116
the	5116
men	5116
had	5116
left	5116
off	5116
rowing	5116
i	5116
went	5116
round	5116
therefore	5116
and	5117
exhorted	5117
them	5117
man	5117
by	5117
man	5117
not	5117
to	5117
lose	5117
heart	5117
my	5119
friends	5119
said	5119
i	5119
this	5119
is	5119
not	5119
the	5119
first	5119
time	5119
that	5119
we	5119
have	5119
been	5119
in	5120
danger	5120
and	5120
we	5120
are	5120
in	5120
nothing	5120
like	5120
so	5120
bad	5120
a	5120
case	5120
as	5120
when	5120
the	5120
cyclops	5120
shut	5121
us	5121
up	5121
in	5121
his	5121
cave	5121
nevertheless	5121
my	5121
courage	5121
and	5121
wise	5121
counsel	5121
saved	5122
us	5122
then	5122
and	5122
we	5122
shall	5122
live	5122
to	5122
look	5122
back	5122
on	5122
all	5122
this	5122
as	5122
well	5122
now	5123
therefore	5123
let	5123
us	5123
all	5123
do	5123
as	5123
i	5123
say	5123
trust	5123
in	5123
jove	5123
and	5123
row	5123
on	5123
with	5123
might	5124
and	5124
main	5124
as	5124
for	5124
you	5124
coxswain	5124
these	5124
are	5124
your	5124
orders	5124
attend	5124
to	5125
them	5125
for	5125
the	5125
ship	5125
is	5125
in	5125
your	5125
hands	5125
turn	5125
her	5125
head	5125
away	5125
from	5125
these	5125
steaming	5126
rapids	5126
and	5126
hug	5126
the	5126
rock	5126
or	5126
she	5126
will	5126
give	5126
you	5126
the	5126
slip	5126
and	5126
be	5127
over	5127
yonder	5127
before	5127
you	5127
know	5127
where	5127
you	5127
are	5127
and	5127
you	5127
will	5127
be	5127
the	5127
death	5128
of	5128
us	5128
so	5130
they	5130
did	5130
as	5130
i	5130
told	5130
them	5130
but	5130
i	5130
said	5130
nothing	5130
about	5130
the	5130
awful	5130
monster	5130
scylla	5131
for	5131
i	5131
knew	5131
the	5131
men	5131
would	5131
not	5131
on	5131
rowing	5131
if	5131
i	5131
did	5131
but	5131
would	5131
huddle	5132
together	5132
in	5132
the	5132
hold	5132
in	5132
one	5132
thing	5132
only	5132
did	5132
i	5132
disobey	5132
circe's	5132
strict	5133
instructions	5133
i	5133
put	5133
on	5133
my	5133
armour	5133
then	5133
seizing	5133
two	5133
strong	5133
spears	5133
i	5134
took	5134
my	5134
stand	5134
on	5134
the	5134
ship	5134
is	5134
bows	5134
for	5134
it	5134
was	5134
there	5134
that	5134
i	5134
expected	5134
first	5135
to	5135
see	5135
the	5135
monster	5135
of	5135
the	5135
rock	5135
who	5135
was	5135
to	5135
do	5135
my	5135
men	5135
so	5135
much	5135
harm	5136
but	5136
i	5136
could	5136
not	5136
make	5136
her	5136
out	5136
anywhere	5136
though	5136
i	5136
strained	5136
my	5136
eyes	5137
with	5137
looking	5137
the	5137
gloomy	5137
rock	5137
all	5137
over	5137
and	5137
over	5137
then	5139
we	5139
entered	5139
the	5139
straits	5139
in	5139
great	5139
fear	5139
of	5139
mind	5139
for	5139
on	5139
the	5139
one	5139
hand	5140
was	5140
scylla	5140
and	5140
on	5140
the	5140
other	5140
dread	5140
charybdis	5140
kept	5140
sucking	5140
up	5140
the	5141
salt	5141
water	5141
as	5141
she	5141
vomited	5141
it	5141
up	5141
it	5141
was	5141
like	5141
the	5141
water	5141
in	5141
a	5141
cauldron	5141
when	5142
it	5142
is	5142
boiling	5142
over	5142
upon	5142
a	5142
great	5142
fire	5142
and	5142
the	5142
spray	5142
reached	5142
the	5142
top	5143
of	5143
the	5143
rocks	5143
on	5143
either	5143
side	5143
when	5143
she	5143
began	5143
to	5143
suck	5143
again	5143
we	5143
could	5144
see	5144
the	5144
water	5144
all	5144
inside	5144
whirling	5144
round	5144
and	5144
round	5144
and	5144
it	5144
made	5144
a	5145
deafening	5145
sound	5145
as	5145
it	5145
broke	5145
against	5145
the	5145
rocks	5145
we	5145
could	5145
see	5145
the	5145
bottom	5146
of	5146
the	5146
whirlpool	5146
all	5146
black	5146
with	5146
sand	5146
and	5146
mud	5146
and	5146
the	5146
men	5146
were	5146
at	5147
their	5147
wit's	5147
ends	5147
for	5147
fear	5147
while	5147
we	5147
were	5147
taken	5147
up	5147
with	5147
this	5147
and	5147
were	5148
expecting	5148
each	5148
moment	5148
to	5148
be	5148
our	5148
last	5148
scylla	5148
pounced	5148
down	5148
suddenly	5148
upon	5149
us	5149
and	5149
snatched	5149
up	5149
my	5149
six	5149
best	5149
men	5149
i	5149
was	5149
looking	5149
at	5149
once	5149
after	5149
both	5150
ship	5150
and	5150
men	5150
and	5150
in	5150
a	5150
moment	5150
i	5150
saw	5150
their	5150
hands	5150
and	5150
feet	5150
ever	5150
so	5151
high	5151
above	5151
me	5151
struggling	5151
in	5151
the	5151
air	5151
as	5151
scylla	5151
was	5151
carrying	5151
them	5151
off	5152
and	5152
i	5152
heard	5152
them	5152
call	5152
out	5152
my	5152
name	5152
in	5152
one	5152
last	5152
despairing	5152
cry	5152
as	5153
a	5153
fisherman	5153
seated	5153
spear	5153
in	5153
hand	5153
upon	5153
some	5153
jutting	5153
rock	5153
throws	5153
bait	5154
into	5154
the	5154
water	5154
to	5154
deceive	5154
the	5154
poor	5154
little	5154
fishes	5154
and	5154
spears	5154
them	5155
with	5155
the	5155
ox's	5155
horn	5155
with	5155
which	5155
his	5155
spear	5155
is	5155
shod	5155
throwing	5155
them	5155
gasping	5156
on	5156
to	5156
the	5156
land	5156
as	5156
he	5156
catches	5156
them	5156
one	5156
by	5156
one	5156
even	5156
so	5156
did	5156
scylla	5157
land	5157
these	5157
panting	5157
creatures	5157
on	5157
her	5157
rock	5157
and	5157
munch	5157
them	5157
up	5157
at	5158
the	5158
mouth	5158
of	5158
her	5158
den	5158
while	5158
they	5158
screamed	5158
and	5158
stretched	5158
out	5158
their	5158
hands	5159
to	5159
me	5159
in	5159
their	5159
mortal	5159
agony	5159
this	5159
was	5159
the	5159
most	5159
sickening	5159
sight	5159
that	5160
i	5160
saw	5160
throughout	5160
all	5160
my	5160
voyages	5160
when	5162
we	5162
had	5162
passed	5162
the	5162
wandering	5162
rocks	5162
with	5162
scylla	5162
and	5162
terrible	5162
charybdis	5163
we	5163
reached	5163
the	5163
noble	5163
island	5163
of	5163
the	5163
sun-god	5163
where	5163
were	5163
the	5164
goodly	5164
cattle	5164
and	5164
sheep	5164
belonging	5164
to	5164
the	5164
sun	5164
hyperion	5164
while	5164
still	5164
at	5165
sea	5165
in	5165
my	5165
ship	5165
i	5165
could	5165
bear	5165
the	5165
cattle	5165
lowing	5165
as	5165
they	5165
came	5165
home	5165
to	5166
the	5166
yards	5166
and	5166
the	5166
sheep	5166
bleating	5166
then	5166
i	5166
remembered	5166
what	5166
the	5166
blind	5166
theban	5167
prophet	5167
teiresias	5167
had	5167
told	5167
me	5167
and	5167
how	5167
carefully	5167
aeaean	5167
circe	5167
had	5168
warned	5168
me	5168
to	5168
shun	5168
the	5168
island	5168
of	5168
the	5168
blessed	5168
sun-god	5168
so	5168
being	5168
much	5169
troubled	5169
i	5169
said	5169
to	5169
the	5169
men	5169
my	5169
men	5169
i	5169
know	5169
you	5169
are	5169
hard	5169
pressed	5169
but	5170
listen	5170
while	5170
i	5170
tell	5170
you	5170
the	5170
prophecy	5170
that	5170
teiresias	5170
made	5170
me	5170
and	5170
how	5171
carefully	5171
aeaean	5171
circe	5171
warned	5171
me	5171
to	5171
shun	5171
the	5171
island	5171
of	5171
the	5171
blessed	5171
sun-god	5172
for	5172
it	5172
was	5172
here	5172
she	5172
said	5172
that	5172
our	5172
worst	5172
danger	5172
would	5172
lie	5172
head	5173
the	5173
ship	5173
therefore	5173
away	5173
from	5173
the	5173
island	5173
the	5175
men	5175
were	5175
in	5175
despair	5175
at	5175
this	5175
and	5175
eurylochus	5175
at	5175
once	5175
gave	5175
me	5175
an	5175
insolent	5176
answer	5176
ulysses	5176
said	5176
he	5176
you	5176
are	5176
cruel	5176
you	5176
are	5176
very	5176
strong	5177
yourself	5177
and	5177
never	5177
get	5177
worn	5177
out	5177
you	5177
seem	5177
to	5177
be	5177
made	5177
of	5177
iron	5177
and	5178
now	5178
though	5178
your	5178
men	5178
are	5178
exhausted	5178
with	5178
toil	5178
and	5178
want	5178
of	5178
sleep	5178
you	5179
will	5179
not	5179
let	5179
them	5179
land	5179
and	5179
cook	5179
themselves	5179
a	5179
good	5179
supper	5179
upon	5179
this	5180
island	5180
but	5180
bid	5180
them	5180
put	5180
out	5180
to	5180
sea	5180
and	5180
go	5180
faring	5180
fruitlessly	5180
on	5181
through	5181
the	5181
watches	5181
of	5181
the	5181
flying	5181
night	5181
it	5181
is	5181
by	5181
night	5181
that	5181
the	5181
winds	5182
blow	5182
hardest	5182
and	5182
do	5182
so	5182
much	5182
damage	5182
how	5182
can	5182
we	5182
escape	5182
should	5182
one	5183
of	5183
those	5183
sudden	5183
squalls	5183
spring	5183
up	5183
from	5183
south	5183
west	5183
or	5183
west	5183
which	5183
so	5184
often	5184
wreck	5184
a	5184
vessel	5184
when	5184
our	5184
lords	5184
the	5184
gods	5184
are	5184
unpropitious	5184
now	5185
therefore	5185
let	5185
us	5185
obey	5185
the	5185
of	5185
night	5185
and	5185
prepare	5185
our	5185
supper	5185
here	5185
hard	5186
by	5186
the	5186
ship	5186
to-morrow	5186
morning	5186
we	5186
will	5186
go	5186
on	5186
board	5186
again	5186
and	5186
put	5187
out	5187
to	5187
sea	5187
thus	5189
spoke	5189
eurylochus	5189
and	5189
the	5189
men	5189
approved	5189
his	5189
words	5189
i	5189
saw	5189
that	5189
heaven	5190
meant	5190
us	5190
a	5190
mischief	5190
and	5190
said	5190
you	5190
force	5190
me	5190
to	5190
yield	5190
for	5190
you	5190
are	5191
many	5191
against	5191
one	5191
but	5191
at	5191
any	5191
rate	5191
each	5191
one	5191
of	5191
you	5191
must	5191
take	5191
his	5191
solemn	5192
oath	5192
that	5192
if	5192
he	5192
meet	5192
with	5192
a	5192
herd	5192
of	5192
cattle	5192
or	5192
a	5192
large	5192
flock	5192
of	5193
sheep	5193
he	5193
will	5193
not	5193
be	5193
so	5193
mad	5193
as	5193
to	5193
kill	5193
a	5193
single	5193
head	5193
of	5193
either	5193
but	5194
will	5194
be	5194
satisfied	5194
with	5194
the	5194
food	5194
that	5194
circe	5194
has	5194
given	5194
us	5194
they	5196
all	5196
swore	5196
as	5196
i	5196
bade	5196
them	5196
and	5196
when	5196
they	5196
had	5196
completed	5196
their	5196
oath	5197
we	5197
made	5197
the	5197
ship	5197
fast	5197
in	5197
a	5197
harbour	5197
that	5197
was	5197
near	5197
a	5197
stream	5197
of	5197
fresh	5198
water	5198
and	5198
the	5198
men	5198
went	5198
ashore	5198
and	5198
cooked	5198
their	5198
suppers	5198
as	5198
soon	5199
as	5199
they	5199
had	5199
had	5199
enough	5199
to	5199
eat	5199
and	5199
drink	5199
they	5199
began	5199
talking	5199
about	5199
their	5200
poor	5200
comrades	5200
whom	5200
scylla	5200
had	5200
snatched	5200
up	5200
and	5200
eaten	5200
this	5200
set	5200
them	5201
weeping	5201
and	5201
they	5201
went	5201
on	5201
crying	5201
till	5201
they	5201
fell	5201
off	5201
into	5201
a	5201
sound	5201
sleep	5202
in	5204
the	5204
third	5204
watch	5204
of	5204
the	5204
night	5204
when	5204
the	5204
stars	5204
had	5204
shifted	5204
their	5204
places	5205
jove	5205
raised	5205
a	5205
great	5205
gale	5205
of	5205
wind	5205
that	5205
flew	5205
a	5205
hurricane	5205
so	5205
that	5206
land	5206
and	5206
sea	5206
were	5206
covered	5206
with	5206
thick	5206
clouds	5206
and	5206
night	5206
sprang	5206
forth	5207
out	5207
of	5207
the	5207
heavens	5207
when	5207
the	5207
child	5207
of	5207
morning	5207
rosy-fingered	5207
dawn	5208
appeared	5208
we	5208
brought	5208
the	5208
ship	5208
to	5208
land	5208
and	5208
drew	5208
her	5208
into	5208
a	5208
cave	5208
wherein	5209
the	5209
sea-nymphs	5209
hold	5209
their	5209
courts	5209
and	5209
dances	5209
and	5209
i	5209
called	5209
the	5210
men	5210
together	5210
in	5210
council	5210
my	5212
friends	5212
said	5212
i	5212
we	5212
have	5212
meat	5212
and	5212
drink	5212
in	5212
the	5212
ship	5212
let	5212
us	5212
mind	5213
therefore	5213
and	5213
not	5213
touch	5213
the	5213
cattle	5213
or	5213
we	5213
shall	5213
suffer	5213
for	5213
it	5214
for	5214
these	5214
cattle	5214
and	5214
sheep	5214
belong	5214
to	5214
the	5214
mighty	5214
sun	5214
who	5214
sees	5214
and	5215
gives	5215
ear	5215
to	5215
everything	5215
and	5215
again	5215
they	5215
promised	5215
that	5215
they	5215
would	5215
obey	5216
for	5218
a	5218
whole	5218
month	5218
the	5218
wind	5218
blew	5218
steadily	5218
from	5218
the	5218
south	5218
and	5218
there	5218
was	5219
no	5219
other	5219
wind	5219
but	5219
only	5219
south	5219
and	5219
east	5219
as	5219
long	5219
as	5219
corn	5219
and	5219
wine	5219
held	5220
out	5220
the	5220
men	5220
did	5220
not	5220
touch	5220
the	5220
cattle	5220
when	5220
they	5220
were	5220
hungry	5220
when	5220
however	5221
they	5221
had	5221
eaten	5221
all	5221
there	5221
was	5221
in	5221
the	5221
ship	5221
they	5221
were	5221
forced	5221
to	5222
go	5222
further	5222
afield	5222
with	5222
hook	5222
and	5222
line	5222
catching	5222
birds	5222
and	5222
taking	5222
whatever	5223
they	5223
could	5223
lay	5223
their	5223
hands	5223
on	5223
for	5223
they	5223
were	5223
starving	5223
one	5223
day	5224
therefore	5224
i	5224
went	5224
up	5224
inland	5224
that	5224
i	5224
might	5224
pray	5224
heaven	5224
to	5224
show	5224
me	5225
some	5225
means	5225
of	5225
getting	5225
away	5225
when	5225
i	5225
had	5225
gone	5225
far	5225
enough	5225
to	5225
be	5225
clear	5225
of	5226
all	5226
my	5226
men	5226
and	5226
had	5226
found	5226
a	5226
place	5226
that	5226
was	5226
well	5226
sheltered	5226
from	5226
the	5227
wind	5227
i	5227
washed	5227
my	5227
hands	5227
and	5227
prayed	5227
to	5227
all	5227
the	5227
gods	5227
in	5227
olympus	5227
till	5228
by	5228
and	5228
by	5228
they	5228
sent	5228
me	5228
off	5228
into	5228
a	5228
sweet	5228
sleep	5228
meanwhile	5230
eurylochus	5230
had	5230
been	5230
giving	5230
evil	5230
counsel	5230
to	5230
the	5230
men	5230
listen	5230
to	5231
me	5231
said	5231
he	5231
my	5231
poor	5231
comrades	5231
all	5231
deaths	5231
are	5231
bad	5231
enough	5231
but	5231
there	5232
is	5232
none	5232
so	5232
bad	5232
as	5232
famine	5232
why	5232
should	5232
not	5232
we	5232
drive	5232
in	5232
the	5232
best	5232
of	5233
these	5233
cows	5233
and	5233
offer	5233
them	5233
in	5233
sacrifice	5233
to	5233
the	5233
immortal	5233
rods	5233
if	5233
we	5234
ever	5234
get	5234
back	5234
to	5234
ithaca	5234
we	5234
can	5234
build	5234
a	5234
fine	5234
temple	5234
to	5234
the	5234
sun-god	5234
and	5235
enrich	5235
it	5235
with	5235
every	5235
kind	5235
of	5235
ornament	5235
if	5235
however	5235
he	5235
is	5235
determined	5235
to	5236
sink	5236
our	5236
ship	5236
out	5236
of	5236
revenge	5236
for	5236
these	5236
homed	5236
cattle	5236
and	5236
the	5236
other	5236
gods	5237
are	5237
of	5237
the	5237
same	5237
mind	5237
i	5237
for	5237
one	5237
would	5237
rather	5237
drink	5237
salt	5237
water	5237
once	5238
for	5238
all	5238
and	5238
have	5238
done	5238
with	5238
it	5238
than	5238
be	5238
starved	5238
to	5238
death	5238
by	5238
inches	5238
in	5239
such	5239
a	5239
desert	5239
island	5239
as	5239
this	5239
is	5239
thus	5241
spoke	5241
eurylochus	5241
and	5241
the	5241
men	5241
approved	5241
his	5241
words	5241
now	5241
the	5241
cattle	5241
so	5242
fair	5242
and	5242
goodly	5242
were	5242
feeding	5242
not	5242
far	5242
from	5242
the	5242
ship	5242
the	5242
men	5242
therefore	5242
drove	5243
in	5243
the	5243
best	5243
of	5243
them	5243
and	5243
they	5243
all	5243
stood	5243
round	5243
them	5243
saying	5243
their	5243
prayers	5244
and	5244
using	5244
young	5244
oak-shoots	5244
instead	5244
of	5244
barley-meal	5244
for	5244
there	5244
was	5245
no	5245
barley	5245
left	5245
when	5245
they	5245
had	5245
done	5245
praying	5245
they	5245
killed	5245
the	5245
cows	5245
and	5246
dressed	5246
their	5246
carcasses	5246
they	5246
cut	5246
out	5246
the	5246
thigh	5246
bones	5246
wrapped	5246
them	5247
round	5247
in	5247
two	5247
layers	5247
of	5247
fat	5247
and	5247
set	5247
some	5247
pieces	5247
of	5247
raw	5247
meat	5247
on	5247
top	5248
of	5248
them	5248
they	5248
had	5248
no	5248
wine	5248
with	5248
which	5248
to	5248
make	5248
drink-offerings	5248
over	5248
the	5249
sacrifice	5249
while	5249
it	5249
was	5249
cooking	5249
so	5249
they	5249
kept	5249
pouring	5249
on	5249
a	5249
little	5249
water	5250
from	5250
time	5250
to	5250
time	5250
while	5250
the	5250
inward	5250
meats	5250
were	5250
being	5250
grilled	5250
then	5251
when	5251
the	5251
thigh	5251
bones	5251
were	5251
burned	5251
and	5251
they	5251
had	5251
tasted	5251
the	5251
inward	5251
meats	5252
they	5252
cut	5252
the	5252
rest	5252
up	5252
small	5252
and	5252
put	5252
the	5252
pieces	5252
upon	5252
the	5252
spits	5252
by	5254
this	5254
time	5254
my	5254
deep	5254
sleep	5254
had	5254
left	5254
me	5254
and	5254
i	5254
turned	5254
back	5254
to	5254
the	5254
ship	5255
and	5255
to	5255
the	5255
sea	5255
shore	5255
as	5255
i	5255
drew	5255
near	5255
i	5255
began	5255
to	5255
smell	5255
hot	5255
roast	5255
meat	5256
so	5256
i	5256
groaned	5256
out	5256
a	5256
prayer	5256
to	5256
the	5256
immortal	5256
gods	5256
father	5256
jove	5256
i	5257
exclaimed	5257
and	5257
all	5257
you	5257
other	5257
gods	5257
who	5257
live	5257
in	5257
everlasting	5257
bliss	5257
you	5258
have	5258
done	5258
me	5258
a	5258
cruel	5258
mischief	5258
by	5258
the	5258
sleep	5258
into	5258
which	5258
you	5258
have	5258
sent	5259
me	5259
see	5259
what	5259
fine	5259
work	5259
these	5259
men	5259
of	5259
mine	5259
have	5259
been	5259
making	5259
in	5259
my	5260
absence	5260
meanwhile	5262
lampetie	5262
went	5262
straight	5262
off	5262
to	5262
the	5262
sun	5262
and	5262
told	5262
him	5262
we	5262
had	5262
been	5263
killing	5263
his	5263
cows	5263
whereon	5263
he	5263
flew	5263
into	5263
a	5263
great	5263
rage	5263
and	5263
said	5263
to	5264
the	5264
immortals	5264
father	5264
jove	5264
and	5264
all	5264

gods	5264
who	5264
live	5264
in	5264
everlasting	5265
bliss	5265
i	5265
must	5265
have	5265
vengeance	5265
on	5265
the	5265
crew	5265
of	5265
ulysses	5265
ship	5265
they	5266
have	5266
had	5266
the	5266
insolence	5266
to	5266
kill	5266
my	5266
cows	5266
which	5266
were	5266
the	5266
one	5266
thing	5266
i	5267
loved	5267
to	5267
look	5267
upon	5267
whether	5267
i	5267
was	5267
going	5267
up	5267
heaven	5267
or	5267
down	5267
again	5267
if	5268
they	5268
do	5268
not	5268
square	5268
accounts	5268
with	5268
me	5268
about	5268
my	5268
cows	5268
i	5268
will	5268
go	5268
down	5268
to	5269
hades	5269
and	5269
shine	5269
there	5269
among	5269
the	5269
dead	5269
sun	5271
said	5271
jove	5271
go	5271
on	5271
shining	5271
upon	5271
us	5271
gods	5271
and	5271
upon	5271
mankind	5271
over	5271
the	5272
fruitful	5272
earth	5272
i	5272
will	5272
shiver	5272
their	5272
ship	5272
into	5272
little	5272
pieces	5272
with	5272
a	5273
bolt	5273
of	5273
white	5273
lightning	5273
as	5273
soon	5273
as	5273
they	5273
get	5273
out	5273
to	5273
sea	5273
i	5275
was	5275
told	5275
all	5275
this	5275
by	5275
calypso	5275
who	5275
said	5275
she	5275
had	5275
heard	5275
it	5275
from	5275
the	5275
mouth	5276
of	5276
mercury	5276
as	5278
soon	5278
as	5278
i	5278
got	5278
down	5278
to	5278
my	5278
ship	5278
and	5278
to	5278
the	5278
sea	5278
shore	5278
i	5278
rebuked	5278
each	5278
one	5279
of	5279
the	5279
men	5279
separately	5279
but	5279
we	5279
could	5279
see	5279
no	5279
way	5279
out	5279
of	5279
it	5279
for	5279
the	5280
cows	5280
were	5280
dead	5280
already	5280
and	5280
indeed	5280
the	5280
gods	5280
began	5280
at	5280
once	5280
to	5280
show	5280
signs	5281
and	5281
wonders	5281
among	5281
us	5281
for	5281
the	5281
hides	5281
of	5281
the	5281
cattle	5281
crawled	5281
about	5281
and	5282
the	5282
joints	5282
upon	5282
the	5282
spits	5282
began	5282
to	5282
low	5282
like	5282
cows	5282
and	5282
the	5282
meat	5282
whether	5283
cooked	5283
or	5283
raw	5283
kept	5283
on	5283
making	5283
a	5283
noise	5283
just	5283
as	5283
cows	5283
do	5283
for	5285
six	5285
days	5285
my	5285
men	5285
kept	5285
driving	5285
in	5285
the	5285
best	5285
cows	5285
and	5285
feasting	5285
upon	5285
them	5286
but	5286
when	5286
jove	5286
the	5286
son	5286
of	5286
saturn	5286
had	5286
added	5286
a	5286
seventh	5286
day	5286
the	5286
fury	5287
of	5287
the	5287
gale	5287
abated	5287
we	5287
therefore	5287
went	5287
on	5287
board	5287
raised	5287
our	5287
masts	5287
spread	5288
sail	5288
and	5288
put	5288
out	5288
to	5288
sea	5288
as	5288
soon	5288
as	5288
we	5288
were	5288
well	5288
away	5288
from	5288
the	5289
island	5289
and	5289
could	5289
see	5289
nothing	5289
but	5289
sky	5289
and	5289
sea	5289
the	5289
son	5289
of	5289
saturn	5289
raised	5290
a	5290
black	5290
cloud	5290
over	5290
our	5290
ship	5290
and	5290
the	5290
sea	5290
grew	5290
dark	5290
beneath	5290
it	5291
we	5291
not	5291
get	5291
on	5291
much	5291
further	5291
for	5291
in	5291
another	5291
moment	5291
we	5291
were	5291
caught	5291
by	5292
a	5292
terrific	5292
squall	5292
from	5292
the	5292
west	5292
that	5292
snapped	5292
the	5292
forestays	5292
of	5292
the	5292
mast	5293
so	5293
that	5293
it	5293
fell	5293
aft	5293
while	5293
all	5293
the	5293
ship's	5293
gear	5293
tumbled	5293
about	5293
at	5294
the	5294
bottom	5294
of	5294
the	5294
vessel	5294
the	5294
mast	5294
fell	5294
upon	5294
the	5294
head	5294
of	5294
the	5294
helmsman	5294
in	5295
the	5295
ship's	5295
stern	5295
so	5295
that	5295
the	5295
bones	5295
of	5295
his	5295
head	5295
were	5295
crushed	5295
to	5295
pieces	5296
and	5296
he	5296
fell	5296
overboard	5296
as	5296
though	5296
he	5296
were	5296
diving	5296
with	5296
no	5296
more	5296
life	5297
left	5297
in	5297
him	5297
then	5299
jove	5299
let	5299
fly	5299
with	5299
his	5299
thunderbolts	5299
and	5299
the	5299
ship	5299
went	5299
round	5299
and	5300
round	5300
and	5300
was	5300
filled	5300
with	5300
fire	5300
and	5300
brimstone	5300
as	5300
the	5300
lightning	5300
struck	5301
it	5301
the	5301
men	5301
all	5301
fell	5301
into	5301
the	5301
sea	5301
they	5301
were	5301
carried	5301
about	5301
in	5302
the	5302
water	5302
round	5302
the	5302
ship	5302
looking	5302
like	5302
so	5302
many	5302
sea-gulls	5302
but	5302
the	5302
god	5303
presently	5303
deprived	5303
them	5303
of	5303
all	5303
chance	5303
of	5303
getting	5303
home	5303
again	5303
i	5305
stuck	5305
to	5305
the	5305
ship	5305
till	5305
the	5305
sea	5305
knocked	5305
her	5305
sides	5305
from	5305
her	5305
keel	5305
which	5306
drifted	5306
about	5306
by	5306
itself	5306
and	5306
struck	5306
the	5306
mast	5306
out	5306
of	5306
her	5306
in	5306
the	5307
direction	5307
of	5307
the	5307
keel	5307
but	5307
there	5307
was	5307
a	5307
backstay	5307
of	5307
stout	5307
ox-thong	5307
still	5308
hanging	5308
about	5308
it	5308
and	5308
with	5308
this	5308
i	5308
lashed	5308
the	5308
mast	5308
and	5308
keel	5308
together	5308
and	5309
getting	5309
astride	5309
of	5309
them	5309
was	5309
carried	5309
wherever	5309
the	5309
winds	5309
chose	5309
to	5309
take	5310
me	5310
the	5312
gale	5312
from	5312
the	5312
west	5312
had	5312
now	5312
spent	5312
its	5312
force	5312
and	5312
the	5312
wind	5312
got	5312
into	5313
the	5313
south	5313
again	5313
which	5313
frightened	5313
me	5313
lest	5313
i	5313
should	5313
be	5313
taken	5313
back	5313
to	5314
the	5314
terrible	5314
whirlpool	5314
of	5314
charybdis	5314
this	5314
indeed	5314
was	5314
what	5314
actually	5314
happened	5315
for	5315
i	5315
was	5315
borne	5315
along	5315
by	5315
the	5315
waves	5315
all	5315
night	5315
and	5315
by	5315
sunrise	5315
had	5316
reacfied	5316
the	5316
rock	5316
of	5316
scylla	5316
and	5316
the	5316
whirlpool	5316
she	5316
was	5316
then	5316
sucking	5316
down	5317
the	5317
salt	5317
sea	5317
water	5317
but	5317
i	5317
was	5317
carried	5317
aloft	5317
toward	5317
the	5317
fig	5317
tree	5317
which	5318
i	5318
caught	5318
hold	5318
of	5318
and	5318
clung	5318
on	5318
to	5318
like	5318
a	5318
bat	5318
i	5318
could	5318
not	5318
plant	5318
my	5319
feet	5319
anywhere	5319
so	5319
as	5319
to	5319
stand	5319
securely	5319
for	5319
the	5319
roots	5319
were	5319
a	5319
long	5319
way	5320
off	5320
and	5320
the	5320
boughs	5320
that	5320
overshadowed	5320
the	5320
whole	5320
pool	5320
were	5320
too	5320
high	5320
too	5321
vast	5321
and	5321
too	5321
far	5321
apart	5321
for	5321
me	5321
to	5321
reach	5321
them	5321
so	5321
i	5321
hung	5321
patiently	5321
on	5322
waiting	5322
till	5322
the	5322
pool	5322
should	5322
discharge	5322
my	5322
mast	5322
and	5322
raft	5322
again	5322
and	5323
a	5323
very	5323
long	5323
while	5323
it	5323
seemed	5323
a	5323
juryman	5323
is	5323
not	5323
more	5323
glad	5323
to	5323
get	5323
home	5324
to	5324
supper	5324
after	5324
having	5324
been	5324
long	5324
detained	5324
in	5324
court	5324
by	5324
troublesome	5324
cases	5325
than	5325
i	5325
was	5325
to	5325
see	5325
my	5325
raft	5325
beginning	5325
to	5325
work	5325
its	5325
way	5325
out	5325
of	5325
the	5326
whirlpool	5326
again	5326
at	5326
last	5326
i	5326
let	5326
go	5326
with	5326
my	5326
hands	5326
and	5326
feet	5326
and	5326
fell	5327
heavily	5327
into	5327
the	5327
sea	5327
bard	5327
by	5327
my	5327
raft	5327
on	5327
to	5327
which	5327
i	5327
then	5327
got	5327
and	5328
began	5328
to	5328
row	5328
with	5328
my	5328
hands	5328
as	5328
for	5328
scylla	5328
the	5328
father	5328
of	5328
gods	5328
and	5329
men	5329
would	5329
not	5329
let	5329
her	5329
get	5329
further	5329
sight	5329
of	5329
me	5329
otherwise	5329
i	5329
should	5329
have	5330
certainly	5330
been	5330
lost	5330

into	5410
a	5410
deep	5410
sweet	5410
and	5410
almost	5410
deathlike	5410
slumber	5410
the	5412
ship	5412
bounded	5412
forward	5412
on	5412
her	5412
way	5412
as	5412
a	5412
four	5412
in	5412
hand	5412
chariot	5412
flies	5412
over	5413
the	5413

horses	5413
feel	5413
the	5413
whip	5413

prow	5413
curveted	5413
as	5413

were	5414
the	5414
neck	5414
of	5414
a	5414
stallion	5414
and	5414
a	5414
great	5414
wave	5414
of	5414
dark	5414
blue	5414
water	5414
seethed	5415
in	5415
her	5415
wake	5415
she	5415
held	5415
steadily	5415
on	5415
her	5415
course	5415

even	5415
a	5415
falcon	5415
swiftest	5416
of	5416
all	5416
birds	5416
could	5416
not	5416
have	5416
kept	5416
pace	5416
with	5416
her	5416
thus	5416
then	5416
she	5417
cut	5417
her	5417
way	5417
through	5417
the	5417
water	5417
carrying	5417
one	5417
who	5417
was	5417
as	5417
cunning	5417
as	5418
the	5418
gods	5418
but	5418
who	5418
was	5418
now	5418
sleeping	5418
peacefully	5418
forgetful	5418
of	5418
all	5418
that	5419
he	5419
had	5419
suffered	5419
both	5419
on	5419
the	5419
field	5419
of	5419
battle	5419
and	5419
by	5419
the	5419
waves	5419
of	5420
the	5420
weary	5420
sea	5420
when	5422
the	5422
bright	5422
star	5422
that	5422
heralds	5422
the	5422
approach	5422
of	5422
dawn	5422
began	5422
to	5422
show	5422
the	5423

near	5423
to	5423
land	5423
now	5423
there	5423
is	5423
in	5423

a	5423
haven	5423
of	5423
the	5423

which	5424
lies	5424
between	5424
two	5424

that	5424
break	5424
the	5424
line	5424
of	5425
the	5425

shut	5425
the	5425

that	5426
when	5426
once	5426
within	5426
it	5426
a	5426

moored	5427
at	5427

who	5429
are	5429
called	5429
naiads	5429
there	5429
are	5429
mixing-bowls	5429
within	5430
it	5430
and	5430
wine-jars	5430
of	5430
stone	5430
and	5430
the	5430
bees	5430
hive	5430
there	5430
moreover	5430
there	5431
are	5431
great	5431
looms	5431
of	5431
stone	5431
on	5431
which	5431
the	5431
nymphs	5431
weave	5431
their	5431
robes	5431
of	5432
sea	5432
purple	5432
very	5432
curious	5432
to	5432
see	5432
and	5432
at	5432
all	5432
times	5432
there	5432
is	5432
water	5432
within	5433
it	5433
it	5433
has	5433
two	5433
entrances	5433
one	5433
facing	5433
north	5433
by	5433
which	5433
mortals	5433
can	5434
go	5434
down	5434
into	5434
the	5434
cave	5434
while	5434
the	5434
other	5434
comes	5434
from	5434
the	5434
south	5434
and	5434
is	5435
more	5435
mysterious	5435
mortals	5435
cannot	5435
possibly	5435
get	5435
in	5435
by	5435
it	5435
it	5435
is	5435
the	5435
way	5436
taken	5436
by	5436
the	5436
gods	5436
into	5438
this	5438
harbour	5438
then	5438
they	5438
took	5438
their	5438
ship	5438
for	5438
they	5438
knew	5438
the	5438
place	5438
she	5439
had	5439
so	5439
much	5439
way	5439
upon	5439
her	5439
that	5439
she	5439
ran	5439
half	5439
her	5439
own	5439
length	5439
on	5439
to	5439
the	5440
shore	5440
when	5440
however	5440
they	5440
had	5440
landed	5440
the	5440
first	5440
thing	5440
they	5440
did	5440
was	5441
to	5441
lift	5441
ulysses	5441
with	5441
his	5441
rug	5441
and	5441
linen	5441
sheet	5441
out	5441
of	5441
the	5441
ship	5441
and	5442
lay	5442
him	5442
down	5442
upon	5442
the	5442
sand	5442
still	5442
fast	5442
asleep	5442
then	5442
they	5442
took	5442
out	5442
the	5443
presents	5443
which	5443
minerva	5443
had	5443
persuaded	5443
the	5443
phaeacians	5443
to	5443
give	5443
him	5443
when	5444
he	5444
was	5444
setting	5444
out	5444
on	5444
his	5444
voyage	5444
homewards	5444
they	5444
put	5444
these	5444
all	5444
together	5445
by	5445
the	5445
root	5445
of	5445
the	5445
olive	5445
tree	5445
away	5445
from	5445
the	5445
road	5445
for	5445
fear	5445
some	5446
passer	5446
by	5446
might	5446
come	5446
and	5446
steal	5446
them	5446
before	5446
ulysses	5446
awoke	5446
and	5446
then	5447
they	5447
made	5447
the	5447
best	5447
of	5447
their	5447
way	5447
home	5447
again	5447
but	5449
neptune	5449
did	5449
not	5449
forget	5449
the	5449
threats	5449
with	5449
which	5449
he	5449
had	5449
already	5449
threatened	5449
ulysses	5450
so	5450
he	5450
took	5450
counsel	5450
with	5450
jove	5450
father	5450
jove	5450
said	5450
he	5450
i	5450
shall	5451
no	5451
longer	5451
be	5451
held	5451
in	5451
any	5451
sort	5451
of	5451
respect	5451
among	5451
you	5451
gods	5451
if	5451
mortals	5452
like	5452
the	5452
phaeacians	5452
who	5452
are	5452
my	5452
own	5452
flesh	5452
and	5452
blood	5452
show	5452
such	5453
small	5453
regard	5453
for	5453
me	5453
i	5453
said	5453
i	5453
would	5453
ulysses	5453
get	5453
home	5453
when	5453
he	5453
had	5454
suffered	5454
sufficiently	5454
i	5454
did	5454
not	5454
say	5454
that	5454
he	5454
should	5454
never	5454
get	5454
home	5455
at	5455
all	5455
for	5455
i	5455
knew	5455
you	5455
had	5455
already	5455
nodded	5455
your	5455
head	5455
about	5455
it	5455
and	5456
promised	5456
that	5456
he	5456
should	5456
do	5456
so	5456
but	5456
now	5456
they	5456
have	5456
brought	5456
him	5456
in	5456
a	5457
ship	5457
fast	5457
asleep	5457
and	5457
have	5457
landed	5457
him	5457
in	5457
ithaca	5457
after	5457
loading	5457
him	5457
with	5458
more	5458
magnificent	5458
presents	5458
of	5458
bronze	5458
gold	5458
and	5458
raiment	5458
than	5458
he	5458
would	5459
ever	5459
have	5459
brought	5459
back	5459
from	5459
troy	5459
if	5459
he	5459
had	5459
had	5459
his	5459
share	5459
of	5459
the	5460
spoil	5460
and	5460
got	5460
home	5460
without	5460
misadventure	5460
and	5462
jove	5462
answered	5462
what	5462
o	5462
lord	5462
of	5462
the	5462
earthquake	5462
are	5462
you	5462
talking	5462
about	5463
the	5463
gods	5463
are	5463
by	5463
no	5463
means	5463
wanting	5463
in	5463
respect	5463
for	5463
you	5463
it	5463
would	5463
be	5464
monstrous	5464
were	5464
they	5464
to	5464
insult	5464
one	5464
so	5464
old	5464
and	5464
honoured	5464
as	5464
you	5464
are	5464
as	5465
regards	5465
mortals	5465
however	5465
if	5465
any	5465
of	5465
them	5465
is	5465
indulging	5465
in	5465
insolence	5465
and	5466
treating	5466
you	5466
disrespectfully	5466
it	5466
will	5466
always	5466
rest	5466
with	5466
yourself	5466
to	5467
deal	5467
with	5467
him	5467
as	5467
you	5467
may	5467
think	5467
proper	5467
so	5467
do	5467
just	5467
as	5467
you	5467
please	5467
i	5469
should	5469
have	5469
done	5469
so	5469
at	5469
once	5469
replied	5469
neptune	5469
if	5469
i	5469
were	5469
not	5469
anxious	5469
to	5470
avoid	5470
anything	5470
that	5470
might	5470
displease	5470
you	5470
now	5470
therefore	5470
i	5470
should	5470
like	5471
to	5471
wreck	5471
the	5471
phaecian	5471
ship	5471
as	5471
it	5471
is	5471
returning	5471
from	5471
its	5471
escort	5471
this	5472
will	5472
stop	5472
them	5472
from	5472
escorting	5472
people	5472
in	5472
future	5472
and	5472
i	5472
should	5472
also	5473
like	5473
to	5473
bury	5473
their	5473
city	5473
under	5473
a	5473
huge	5473
mountain	5473
my	5475
good	5475
friend	5475
answered	5475
jove	5475
i	5475
should	5475
recommend	5475
you	5475
at	5475
the	5475
very	5475
moment	5476
when	5476
the	5476
people	5476
from	5476
the	5476
city	5476
are	5476
watching	5476
the	5476
ship	5476
on	5476
her	5476
way	5477
to	5477
turn	5477
it	5477
into	5477
a	5477
rock	5477
near	5477
the	5477
land	5477
and	5477
looking	5477
like	5477
a	5477
ship	5477
this	5478
will	5478
astonish	5478
everybody	5478
and	5478
you	5478
can	5478
then	5478
bury	5478
their	5478
city	5478
under	5478
the	5479
mountain	5479
when	5481
earth-encircling	5481
neptune	5481
heard	5481
this	5481
he	5481
went	5481
to	5481
scheria	5481
where	5481
the	5482
phaecians	5482
live	5482
and	5482
stayed	5482
there	5482
till	5482
the	5482
ship	5482
which	5482
was	5482
making	5482
rapid	5483
way	5483
had	5483
got	5483
close-in	5483
then	5483
he	5483
went	5483
up	5483
to	5483
it	5483
turned	5483
it	5483
into	5483
stone	5484
and	5484
drove	5484
it	5484
down	5484
with	5484
the	5484
flat	5484
of	5484
his	5484
hand	5484
so	5484
as	5484
to	5484
root	5484
it	5484
in	5485
the	5485
ground	5485
after	5485
this	5485
he	5485
went	5485
away	5485
the	5487
phaeacians	5487
then	5487
began	5487
talking	5487
among	5487
themselves	5487
and	5487
one	5487
would	5487
turn	5488
towards	5488
his	5488
neighbour	5488
saying	5488
bless	5488
my	5488
heart	5488
who	5488
is	5488
it	5488
that	5488
can	5489
have	5489
rooted	5489
the	5489
ship	5489
in	5489
the	5489
sea	5489
just	5489
as	5489
she	5489
was	5489
getting	5489
into	5489
port	5489
we	5490
could	5490
see	5490
the	5490
whole	5490
of	5490
her	5490
only	5490
moment	5490
ago	5490
this	5492
was	5492
how	5492
they	5492
talked	5492
but	5492
they	5492
knew	5492
nothing	5492
about	5492
it	5492
and	5492
alcinous	5492
said	5493
i	5493
remember	5493
now	5493
the	5493
old	5493
prophecy	5493
of	5493
my	5493
father	5493
he	5493
said	5493
that	5493
neptune	5494
would	5494
be	5494
angry	5494
with	5494
us	5494
for	5494
taking	5494
every	5494
one	5494
so	5494
safely	5494
over	5494
the	5495
sea	5495
and	5495
would	5495
one	5495
day	5495
wreck	5495
a	5495
phaeacian	5495
ship	5495
as	5495
it	5495
was	5495
returning	5495
from	5496
an	5496
escort	5496
and	5496
bury	5496
our	5496
city	5496
under	5496
a	5496
high	5496
mountain	5496
this	5496
was	5496
what	5497
my	5497
old	5497
father	5497
used	5497
to	5497
say	5497
and	5497
now	5497
it	5497
is	5497
all	5497
coming	5497
true	5497
now	5497
therefore	5498
let	5498
us	5498
all	5498
do	5498
as	5498
i	5498
say	5498
in	5498
the	5498
first	5498
place	5498
we	5498
must	5498
leave	5498
off	5499
giving	5499
people	5499
escorts	5499
when	5499
they	5499
come	5499
here	5499
and	5499
in	5499
the	5499
next	5499
let	5499
us	5500
sacrifice	5500
twelve	5500
picked	5500
bulls	5500
to	5500
neptune	5500
that	5500
he	5500
may	5500
have	5500
mercy	5500
upon	5501
us	5501
and	5501
not	5501
bury	5501
our	5501
city	5501
under	5501
the	5501
high	5501
mountain	5501
when	5501
the	5501
people	5502
heard	5502
this	5502
they	5502
were	5502
afraid	5502
and	5502
got	5502
ready	5502
the	5502
bulls	5502
thus	5504
did	5504
the	5504
chiefs	5504
and	5504
rulers	5504
of	5504
the	5504
phaecians	5504
to	5504
king	5504
neptune	5504
standing	5504
round	5505
his	5505
altar	5505
and	5505
at	5505
the	5505
same	5505
time	5505
ulysses	5505
woke	5505
up	5505
once	5505
more	5505
upon	5505
his	5506
own	5506
soil	5506
he	5506
had	5506
been	5506
so	5506
long	5506
away	5506
that	5506
he	5506
did	5506
not	5506
know	5506
it	5506
again	5506
moreover	5507
jove's	5507
daughter	5507
minerva	5507
had	5507
made	5507
it	5507
a	5507
foggy	5507
day	5507
so	5507
that	5507
people	5508
might	5508
not	5508
know	5508
of	5508
his	5508
having	5508
come	5508
and	5508
that	5508
she	5508
might	5508
tell	5508
him	5509
everything	5509
without	5509
either	5509
his	5509
wife	5509
or	5509
his	5509
fellow	5509
citizens	5509
and	5509
friends	5510
recognizing	5510
him	5510
until	5510
he	5510
had	5510
taken	5510
his	5510
revenge	5510
upon	5510
the	5510
wicked	5510
suitors	5511
everything	5511
therefore	5511
seemed	5511
quite	5511
different	5511
to	5511
him	5511
the	5511
long	5512
straight	5512
tracks	5512
the	5512
harbours	5512
the	5512
precipices	5512
and	5512
the	5512
goodly	5512
trees	5513
appeared	5513
all	5513
changed	5513
as	5513
he	5513
started	5513
up	5513
and	5513
looked	5513
upon	5513
his	5513
native	5513
land	5514
so	5514
he	5514
smote	5514
his	5514
thighs	5514
with	5514
the	5514
flat	5514
of	5514
his	5514
hands	5514
and	5514
cried	5514
aloud	5515
despairingly	5515
alas	5517
he	5517
exclaimed	5517
among	5517
what	5517
manner	5517
of	5517
people	5517
am	5517
i	5517
fallen	5517
are	5517
they	5518
savage	5518
and	5518
uncivilized	5518
or	5518
hospitable	5518
and	5518
humane	5518
where	5518
shall	5518
i	5519
put	5519
all	5519
this	5519
treasure	5519
and	5519
which	5519
way	5519
shall	5519
i	5519
go	5519
i	5519
wish	5519
i	5519
had	5519
stayed	5519
over	5520
there	5520
with	5520
the	5520
phaeacians	5520
or	5520
i	5520
could	5520
have	5520
gone	5520
to	5520
some	5520
other	5520
great	5521
chief	5521
who	5521
would	5521
have	5521
been	5521
good	5521
to	5521
me	5521
and	5521
given	5521
me	5521
an	5521
escort	5521
as	5522
it	5522
is	5522
i	5522
do	5522
not	5522
know	5522
where	5522
to	5522
put	5522
my	5522
treasure	5522
and	5522
i	5522
cannot	5522
leave	5522
it	5523
here	5523
for	5523
fear	5523
somebody	5523
else	5523
should	5523
get	5523
hold	5523
of	5523
it	5523
in	5523
good	5523
truth	5523
the	5524
chiefs	5524
and	5524
rulers	5524
of	5524
the	5524
phaeacians	5524
have	5524
not	5524
been	5524
dealing	5524
fairly	5524
by	5525
me	5525
and	5525
have	5525
left	5525
me	5525
in	5525
the	5525
wrong	5525
country	5525
they	5525
said	5525
they	5525
would	5525
take	5526
me	5526
back	5526
to	5526
ithaca	5526
and	5526
they	5526
have	5526
not	5526
done	5526
so	5526
may	5526
jove	5526
the	5526
protector	5526
of	5527
suppliants	5527
chastise	5527
them	5527
for	5527
he	5527
watches	5527
over	5527
everybody	5527
and	5527
punishes	5527
those	5528
who	5528
do	5528
wrong	5528
still	5528
i	5528
suppose	5528
i	5528
must	5528
count	5528
my	5528
goods	5528
and	5528
see	5528
if	5529
the	5529
crew	5529
have	5529
gone	5529
off	5529
with	5529
any	5529
of	5529
them	5529
he	5531
counted	5531
his	5531
goodly	5531
coppers	5531
and	5531
cauldrons	5531
his	5531
gold	5531
and	5531
all	5531
his	5531
clothes	5532
but	5532
there	5532
was	5532
nothing	5532
missing	5532
still	5532
he	5532
kept	5532
grieving	5532
about	5532
not	5533
being	5533
in	5533
his	5533
own	5533
country	5533
and	5533
wandered	5533
up	5533
and	5533
down	5533
by	5533
the	5533
shore	5533
of	5534
the	5534
sounding	5534
sea	5534
bewailing	5534
his	5534
hard	5534
fate	5534
then	5534
minerva	5534
came	5534
up	5534
to	5535
him	5535
disguised	5535
as	5535
a	5535
young	5535
shepherd	5535
of	5535
delicate	5535
and	5535
princely	5535
mien	5535
with	5536
a	5536
good	5536
cloak	5536
folded	5536
double	5536
about	5536
her	5536
shoulders	5536
she	5536
had	5536
sandals	5536
on	5537
her	5537
comely	5537
feet	5537
and	5537
held	5537
a	5537
javelin	5537
in	5537
her	5537
hand	5537
ulysses	5537
was	5537
glad	5537
when	5538
he	5538
saw	5538
her	5538
and	5538
went	5538
straight	5538
up	5538
to	5538
her	5538
my	5540
friend	5540
said	5540
he	5540

and	5543
pray	5543
to	5543

its	5544

the	5545
sea	5545
board	5545
of	5545
some	5545
continent	5545
minerva	5547
answered	5547
stranger	5547
you	5547
must	5547
be	5547
very	5547
simple	5547
or	5547
must	5547

come	5548
from	5548
somewhere	5548
a	5548
long	5548
way	5548
off	5548
not	5548
to	5548
know	5548
what	5548
country	5548
this	5548
is	5549
it	5549
is	5549
a	5549
very	5549
celebrated	5549
place	5549
and	5549
everybody	5549
knows	5549
it	5549
east	5549
and	5549
west	5550
it	5550
is	5550
rugged	5550
and	5550
not	5550
a	5550
good	5550
driving	5550
country	5550
but	5550
it	5550
is	5550
by	5550

where	5554
the	5554

never	5554

sir	5554
the	5554

is	5555
known	5555
even	5555
as	5555
far	5555
as	5555
troy	5555
which	5555
i	5555
understand	5555
to	5555
be	5555
a	5555
long	5556
way	5556
off	5556
from	5556
this	5556
achaean	5556
country	5556
ulysses	5558
was	5558
glad	5558
at	5558
finding	5558
himself	5558
as	5558
minerva	5558
told	5558
him	5558
in	5558
his	5558
own	5558
country	5559
and	5559
he	5559
began	5559
to	5559
answer	5559
but	5559
he	5559
did	5559
not	5559
speak	5559
the	5559
truth	5559
and	5559
made	5560
up	5560
a	5560
lying	5560
story	5560
in	5560
the	5560
instinctive	5560
wiliness	5560
of	5560
his	5560
heart	5560
i	5562
heard	5562
of	5562
ithaca	5562
said	5562
he	5562
when	5562
i	5562
was	5562
in	5562
crete	5562
beyond	5562
the	5562
seas	5562
and	5563
now	5563
it	5563
seems	5563
i	5563
have	5563
reached	5563
it	5563
with	5563
all	5563
these	5563
treasures	5563
i	5563
have	5563
left	5564
as	5564
much	5564
more	5564
behind	5564
me	5564
for	5564
my	5564
children	5564
but	5564
am	5564
flying	5564
because	5564
i	5565
killed	5565
orsilochus	5565
son	5565
of	5565
idomeneus	5565
the	5565
fleetest	5565
runner	5565
in	5565
crete	5565
i	5566
killed	5566
him	5566
because	5566
he	5566
wanted	5566
to	5566
rob	5566
me	5566
of	5566
the	5566
spoils	5566
i	5566
had	5566
got	5566
from	5566
troy	5567
with	5567
so	5567
much	5567
trouble	5567
and	5567
danger	5567
both	5567
on	5567
the	5567
field	5567
of	5567
battle	5567
and	5567
by	5568
the	5568
waves	5568
of	5568
the	5568
weary	5568
sea	5568
he	5568
said	5568
i	5568
had	5568
not	5568
served	5568
his	5568
father	5568
loyally	5569
at	5569
troy	5569
as	5569
vassal	5569
but	5569
had	5569
set	5569
myself	5569
up	5569
as	5569
an	5569
independent	5569
ruler	5570
so	5570
i	5570
lay	5570
in	5570
wait	5570
for	5570
him	5570
and	5570
with	5570
one	5570
of	5570
my	5570
followers	5570
by	5570
the	5570
road	5571
side	5571
and	5571
speared	5571
him	5571
as	5571
he	5571
was	5571
coming	5571
into	5571
town	5571
from	5571
the	5571
country	5571
my	5572
it	5572
was	5572
a	5572
very	5572
dark	5572
night	5572
and	5572
nobody	5572
saw	5572
us	5572
it	5572
was	5572
not	5572
known	5572
therefore	5572
that	5573
i	5573
had	5573
killed	5573
him	5573
but	5573
as	5573
soon	5573
as	5573
i	5573
had	5573
done	5573
so	5573
i	5573
went	5573
to	5573
a	5573
ship	5573
and	5574
besought	5574
the	5574
owners	5574
who	5574
were	5574
phoenicians	5574
to	5574
take	5574
me	5574
on	5574
board	5574
and	5575
set	5575
me	5575
in	5575
pylos	5575
or	5575
in	5575
elis	5575
where	5575
the	5575
epeans	5575
rule	5575
giving	5575
them	5575
as	5576
much	5576
spoil	5576
as	5576
satisfied	5576
them	5576
they	5576
meant	5576
no	5576
guile	5576
but	5576
the	5576
wind	5576
drove	5577
them	5577
off	5577
their	5577
course	5577
and	5577
we	5577
sailed	5577
on	5577
till	5577
we	5577
came	5577
hither	5577
by	5578
night	5578
it	5578
was	5578
all	5578
we	5578
could	5578
do	5578
to	5578
get	5578
inside	5578
the	5578
harbour	5578
and	5578
none	5578
of	5579
us	5579
said	5579
a	5579
word	5579
about	5579
supper	5579
though	5579
we	5579
wanted	5579
it	5579
badly	5579
but	5579
we	5579
all	5579
went	5580
on	5580
shore	5580
and	5580
lay	5580
down	5580
just	5580
as	5580
we	5580
were	5580
i	5580
was	5580
very	5580
tired	5580
and	5580
fell	5580
asleep	5581
directly	5581
so	5581
they	5581
took	5581
my	5581
goods	5581
out	5581
of	5581
the	5581
ship	5581
and	5581
placed	5581
them	5582
beside	5582
me	5582
where	5582
i	5582
was	5582
lying	5582
upon	5582
the	5582
sand	5582
then	5582
they	5582
sailed	5582
away	5582
to	5583
sidonia	5583
and	5583
i	5583
was	5583
left	5583
here	5583
in	5583
great	5583
distress	5583
of	5583
mind	5583
such	5585
was	5585
his	5585
story	5585
but	5585
minerva	5585
smiled	5585
and	5585
caressed	5585
him	5585
with	5585
her	5585
hand	5585
then	5586
she	5586
took	5586
the	5586
form	5586
of	5586
a	5586
woman	5586
fair	5586
stately	5586
and	5586
wise	5586
he	5586
must	5586
be	5587
indeed	5587
a	5587
shifty	5587
lying	5587
fellow	5587
said	5587
she	5587
who	5587
could	5587
surpass	5587
you	5587
in	5588
all	5588
manner	5588
of	5588
craft	5588
even	5588
though	5588
you	5588
had	5588
a	5588
god	5588
for	5588
your	5588
antagonist	5588
dare-devil	5589
that	5589
you	5589
are	5589
full	5589
of	5589
guile	5589
unwearying	5589
in	5589
deceit	5589
can	5589
you	5590
not	5590
drop	5590
your	5590
tricks	5590
and	5590
your	5590
instinctive	5590
falsehood	5590
even	5590
now	5590
that	5591
you	5591
are	5591
in	5591
your	5591
own	5591
country	5591
again	5591
we	5591
will	5591
say	5591
no	5591
more	5591
however	5591
about	5592
this	5592
for	5592
we	5592
can	5592
both	5592
of	5592
us	5592
deceive	5592
upon	5592
occasion	5592
you	5592
are	5592
the	5592
most	5593
accomplished	5593
counsellor	5593
and	5593
orator	5593
among	5593
all	5593
mankind	5593
while	5593
i	5593
for	5594
diplomacy	5594
and	5594
subtlety	5594
have	5594
no	5594
equal	5594
among	5594

so	5597
great	5597
a	5597

insolence	5602
without	5602

your	5605
appearance	5605
that	5605
when	5605
he	5605
meets	5605
you	5606
it	5606
is	5606
a	5606
hard	5606
matter	5606
for	5606
him	5606
to	5606
know	5606
whether	5606
it	5606
is	5606
you	5606
or	5606
not	5606
this	5607
much	5607
however	5607
i	5607
know	5607
exceedingly	5607
well	5607
you	5607
were	5607
very	5607
kind	5607
to	5607
me	5608
as	5608
long	5608
as	5608
we	5608
achaeans	5608
were	5608
fighting	5608
before	5608
troy	5608
but	5608
from	5608
the	5608
day	5609
on	5609
which	5609
we	5609
went	5609
on	5609
board	5609
ship	5609
after	5609
having	5609
sacked	5609
the	5609
city	5609
of	5609
priam	5610
and	5610
heaven	5610
dispersed	5610
us	5610
from	5610
that	5610
day	5610
minerva	5610
i	5610
saw	5610
no	5610
more	5610
of	5611
you	5611
and	5611
cannot	5611
ever	5611
remember	5611
your	5611
coming	5611
to	5611
my	5611
ship	5611
to	5611
help	5611
me	5611
in	5612
a	5612
difficulty	5612
i	5612
had	5612
to	5612
wander	5612
on	5612
sick	5612
and	5612
sorry	5612
till	5612
the	5612
gods	5612
delivered	5612
me	5613
from	5613
evil	5613
and	5613
i	5613
reached	5613
the	5613
city	5613
of	5613
the	5613
phaeacians	5613
where	5613
you	5613
encouraged	5613
me	5614
and	5614
took	5614
me	5614
into	5614
the	5614
town	5614
and	5614
now	5614
i	5614
beseech	5614
you	5614
in	5614
your	5614
father's	5614
name	5615
tell	5615
me	5615
the	5615
truth	5615
for	5615
i	5615
do	5615
not	5615
believe	5615
i	5615
am	5615
really	5615
back	5615
in	5615
ithaca	5616
i	5616
am	5616
in	5616
some	5616
other	5616
country	5616
and	5616
you	5616
are	5616
mocking	5616
me	5616
and	5616
deceiving	5616
me	5617
in	5617
all	5617
you	5617
have	5617
been	5617
saying	5617
tell	5617
me	5617
then	5617
truly	5617
have	5617
i	5617
really	5617
got	5618
back	5618
to	5618
my	5618
own	5618
country	5618
you	5620
are	5620
always	5620
taking	5620
something	5620
of	5620
that	5620
sort	5620
into	5620
your	5620
head	5620
replied	5620
minerva	5621
and	5621
that	5621
is	5621
why	5621
i	5621
cannot	5621
desert	5621
you	5621
in	5621
your	5621
afflictions	5621
you	5622
are	5622
so	5622
plausible	5622
shrewd	5622
and	5622
shifty	5622
any	5622
one	5622
but	5622
yourself	5622
on	5622
returning	5622
from	5623
so	5623
long	5623
a	5623
voyage	5623
would	5623
at	5623
once	5623
have	5623
gone	5623
home	5623
to	5623
see	5623
his	5623
wife	5623
and	5624
children	5624
but	5624
you	5624
do	5624
not	5624
seem	5624
to	5624
care	5624
about	5624
asking	5624
after	5624
them	5624
or	5625
hearing	5625
any	5625
news	5625
about	5625
them	5625
till	5625
you	5625
have	5625
exploited	5625
your	5625
wife	5625
who	5626
remains	5626
at	5626
home	5626
vainly	5626
grieving	5626
for	5626
you	5626
and	5626
having	5626
no	5626
peace	5626
night	5626
or	5627
day	5627
for	5627
the	5627
tears	5627
she	5627
sheds	5627
on	5627
your	5627
behalf	5627
as	5627
for	5627
my	5627
not	5627
coming	5627
near	5628
you	5628
i	5628
was	5628
never	5628
uneasy	5628
about	5628
you	5628
for	5628
i	5628
was	5628
certain	5628
you	5628
would	5628
get	5629
back	5629
safely	5629
though	5629
you	5629
would	5629
lose	5629
all	5629
your	5629
men	5629
and	5629
i	5629
did	5629
not	5629
wish	5630
to	5630
quarrel	5630
with	5630
my	5630
uncle	5630
neptune	5630
who	5630
never	5630
forgave	5630
you	5630
for	5630
having	5630
blinded	5631
his	5631
son	5631
i	5631
will	5631
now	5631
however	5631
point	5631
out	5631
to	5631
you	5631
the	5631
lie	5631
of	5631
the	5632
land	5632
and	5632
you	5632
will	5632
then	5632
perhaps	5632
believe	5632
me	5632
this	5632
is	5632
the	5632
haven	5632
of	5633
the	5633
old	5633
merman	5633
phorcys	5633
and	5633
here	5633
is	5633
the	5633
olive	5633
tree	5633
that	5633
grows	5633
at	5633
the	5634
head	5634
of	5634
it	5634
near	5634
it	5634
is	5634
the	5634
cave	5634
sacred	5634
to	5634
the	5634
naiads	5634
here	5634
too	5634
is	5635
the	5635
overarching	5635
cavern	5635
in	5635
which	5635
you	5635
have	5635
offered	5635
many	5635
an	5635
acceptable	5635
hecatomb	5636
to	5636
the	5636
nymphs	5636
and	5636
this	5636
is	5636
the	5636
wooded	5636
mountain	5636
neritum	5636
as	5638
she	5638
spoke	5638
the	5638
goddess	5638
dispersed	5638
the	5638
mist	5638
and	5638
the	5638
land	5638
appeared	5638
then	5639
ulysses	5639
rejoiced	5639
at	5639
finding	5639
himself	5639
again	5639
in	5639
his	5639
own	5639
land	5639
and	5639
kissed	5640
the	5640
bounteous	5640
soil	5640
he	5640
lifted	5640
up	5640
his	5640
hands	5640
and	5640
prayed	5640
to	5640
the	5640
nymphs	5641
saying	5641
naiad	5641
nymphs	5641
daughters	5641
of	5641
jove	5641
i	5641
made	5641
sure	5641
that	5641
i	5642
was	5642
never	5642
again	5642
to	5642
see	5642
you	5642
now	5642
therefore	5642
i	5642
greet	5642
you	5642
with	5642
all	5642
loving	5642
salutations	5643
and	5643
i	5643
will	5643
bring	5643
you	5643
offerings	5643
as	5643
in	5643
the	5643
old	5643
days	5643
if	5643
jove's	5644
redoubtable	5644
daughter	5644
will	5644
grant	5644
me	5644
life	5644
and	5644
bring	5644
my	5644
son	5644
to	5644
manhood	5645
take	5647
heart	5647
and	5647
do	5647
not	5647
trouble	5647
yourself	5647
about	5647
that	5647
rejoined	5647
minerva	5647
let	5648
us	5648
rather	5648
set	5648
about	5648
stowing	5648
your	5648
things	5648
at	5648
once	5648
in	5648
the	5648
cave	5648
where	5649
they	5649
will	5649
be	5649
quite	5649
safe	5649
let	5649
us	5649
see	5649
how	5649
we	5649
can	5649
best	5649
manage	5649
it	5649
all	5650
therewith	5652
she	5652
went	5652
down	5652
into	5652
the	5652
cave	5652
to	5652
look	5652
for	5652
the	5652
safest	5652
hiding	5652
places	5653
while	5653
ulysses	5653
brought	5653
up	5653
all	5653
the	5653
treasure	5653
of	5653
gold	5653
bronze	5653
and	5654
good	5654
clothing	5654
which	5654
the	5654
phaecians	5654
had	5654
given	5654
him	5654
they	5654
stowed	5654
everything	5654
carefully	5655
away	5655
and	5655
minerva	5655
set	5655
a	5655
stone	5655
against	5655
the	5655
door	5655
of	5655
the	5655
cave	5655

down	5656
by	5656
the	5656
root	5656
of	5656
the	5656
great	5656
olive	5656
and	5656
consulted	5656
how	5657
to	5657
compass	5657
the	5657
destruction	5657
of	5657
the	5657
wicked	5657
suitors	5657

how	5659
you	5659
can	5659
lay	5660
hands	5660
on	5660
these	5660
disreputable	5660
people	5660
who	5660
have	5660
been	5660
lording	5660
it	5660
in	5660
your	5661

these	5661
three	5661
years	5661
courting	5661
your	5661

making	5661

to	5662
her	5662
while	5662
she	5662
does	5662
nothing	5662

lament	5662
your	5662
absence	5662
giving	5662

and	5663
sending	5663
your	5663
encouraging	5663
messages	5663
to	5663
every	5663
one	5663
of	5663

opposite	5664
of	5664
all	5664

ulysses	5666
answered	5666
in	5666
good	5666
truth	5666
goddess	5666
it	5666
seems	5666
i	5666
should	5666
have	5666
come	5667
to	5667
much	5667
the	5667
same	5667
bad	5667
end	5667
in	5667
my	5667
own	5667
house	5667
as	5667
agamemnon	5667
did	5667
if	5667
you	5668

not	5668
given	5668
me	5668
such	5668
timely	5668

by	5669
my	5669

and	5669
put	5669
your	5669
courage	5669
into	5669
my	5669
heart	5670
as	5670
on	5670
the	5670
day	5670
when	5670
we	5670
loosed	5670
troy's	5670

then	5671
and	5671
i	5671
will	5671
fight	5671
three	5671
hundred	5671
men	5671
if	5671
you	5672

be	5672
with	5672
me	5672
trust	5674
me	5674
for	5674
that	5674

i	5674
will	5674
not	5674
lose	5674
sight	5674
of	5674
you	5674
when	5674
once	5675
we	5675
set	5675
about	5675
it	5675
and	5675
i	5675
would	5675
imagine	5675
that	5675
some	5675
of	5675
those	5675
who	5675
are	5675
devouring	5676
your	5676
substance	5676
will	5676
then	5676
bespatter	5676
the	5676
pavement	5676
with	5676
their	5676
blood	5677
and	5677
brains	5677
i	5677
will	5677
begin	5677
by	5677
disguising	5677
you	5677
so	5677
that	5677
no	5677
human	5677
being	5678
shall	5678
know	5678

cover	5678
your	5678

shall	5678
lose	5679
all	5679
your	5679
yellow	5679

i	5679
will	5679
clothe	5679
you	5679

fill	5680
all	5680

it	5680
with	5680
loathing	5680

will	5680
blear	5680
your	5680
fine	5680
eyes	5680
for	5680
you	5681
and	5681
make	5681
you	5681
an	5681
unseemly	5681
object	5681
in	5681
the	5681
sight	5681
of	5681
the	5681

them	5830

all	5831
manner	5831
of	5831
questions	5831
crying	5831
all	5832

you	5833
too	5833

man	5833
for	5833
a	5833
shirt	5833
and	5833
a	5833

doubtless	5833
make	5833
up	5833
a	5834
very	5834
pretty	5834
story	5834

the	5834
wolves	5834

shall	5838
never	5838
find	5838
so	5838
good	5838
a	5838
master	5838
not	5839
even	5839
if	5839

go	5839
home	5839
to	5839
my	5839
mother	5839

born	5840
i	5840
do	5840
not	5840
so	5840
much	5840
care	5840
however	5840
about	5840
my	5840
parents	5840
now	5840
though	5841
i	5841
should	5841
dearly	5841
like	5841
to	5841
see	5841
them	5841
again	5841
in	5841
my	5841
own	5841
country	5841
it	5841
is	5842
the	5842
loss	5842
of	5842
ulysses	5842
that	5842
grieves	5842
me	5842
most	5842
i	5842
cannot	5842
speak	5842
of	5842
him	5842
without	5843
reverence	5843
though	5843
he	5843
is	5843
here	5843
no	5843
longer	5843
for	5843
he	5843
was	5843
very	5843
fond	5843
of	5844
me	5844
and	5844
took	5844
such	5844
care	5844
of	5844
me	5844
that	5844
whereever	5844
he	5844
may	5844
be	5844
i	5844
shall	5844
always	5844
honour	5845
his	5845
memory	5845
my	5847
friend	5847
replied	5847
ulysses	5847
you	5847
are	5847
very	5847
positive	5847
and	5847
very	5847
hard	5847
of	5848
belief	5848
about	5848
your	5848
master's	5848
coming	5848
home	5848
again	5848
nevertheless	5848
i	5848
will	5848
not	5849
merely	5849
say	5849
but	5849
will	5849
swear	5849
that	5849
he	5849
is	5849
coming	5849
do	5849
not	5849
give	5849
me	5849
anything	5850

my	5850
news	5850
till	5850
he	5850
has	5850
actually	5850
come	5850
you	5850
may	5850

give	5850
me	5851
a	5851
shirt	5851

cloak	5851
of	5851
good	5851

you	5851
will	5851
i	5851
am	5851
in	5851
great	5851

not	5852
take	5852
anything	5852
at	5852
all	5852
till	5852
then	5852
for	5852
i	5852
hate	5852
a	5852
man	5852
even	5852
as	5853
i	5853
hate	5853
hell	5853

lets	5853
his	5853
poverty	5853
tempt	5853
him	5853
into	5853

by	5854
king	5854
jove	5854
by	5854
the	5854
rites	5854
of	5854
hospitality	5854

of	5855
ulysses	5855
to	5855
which	5855
i	5855
have	5855
now	5855
come	5855
that	5855
all	5855

surely	5855
happen	5855
as	5855
i	5856
have	5856
said	5856
it	5856
will	5856
ulysses	5856

return	5856
in	5856
this	5856

and	5857
the	5857
beginning	5857
of	5857
the	5857

be	5857
here	5857
to	5858
do	5858
vengeance	5858
on	5858
all	5858
those	5858

ill	5858
treating	5858
his	5858

talk	5862
about	5862
something	5862

reminding	5863
me	5863
of	5863
all	5863
this	5863

for	5883
a	5883
whole	5883
twelve	5883
months	5883
without	5883

the	5883

of	5884
the	5884
sorrows	5884
with	5884
which	5884
it	5884
has	5884
pleased	5884
heaven	5884
to	5884
visit	5884
me	5884
i	5886
am	5886
by	5886
birth	5886
a	5886
cretan	5886
my	5886
father	5886
was	5886
a	5886
well-to-do	5886
man	5886
who	5886
had	5886
many	5886
sons	5887
born	5887
in	5887
marriage	5887
whereas	5887
i	5887
was	5887
the	5887
son	5887
of	5887
a	5887
slave	5887
whom	5887
he	5887
had	5887
purchased	5888
for	5888
a	5888
concubine	5888
nevertheless	5888
my	5888
father	5888
castor	5888
son	5888
of	5888
hylax	5888
whose	5889
lineage	5889
i	5889
claim	5889
and	5889
who	5889
was	5889
held	5889
in	5889
the	5889
highest	5889
honour	5889
among	5889
the	5890
cretans	5890
for	5890
his	5890
wealth	5890
prosperity	5890
and	5890
the	5890
valour	5890
of	5890
his	5890
sons	5890
put	5891
me	5891
on	5891
the	5891
same	5891
level	5891
with	5891
my	5891
brothers	5891
who	5891
had	5891
been	5891
born	5891
in	5891
wedlock	5891
when	5892
however	5892
death	5892
took	5892
him	5892
to	5892
the	5892
house	5892
of	5892
hades	5892
his	5892
sons	5892
divided	5892
his	5893
estate	5893
and	5893
cast	5893
lots	5893
for	5893
their	5893
shares	5893
but	5893
to	5893
me	5893
they	5893
gave	5893
a	5893
holding	5893
and	5894
little	5894
else	5894
nevertheless	5894
my	5894
valour	5894
enabled	5894
me	5894
to	5894
marry	5894
into	5894
a	5895
rich	5895
family	5895
for	5895
i	5895
was	5895
not	5895
given	5895
to	5895
bragging	5895
or	5895
shirking	5895
on	5895
the	5895
field	5896
of	5896
battle	5896
it	5896
is	5896
all	5896
over	5896
now	5896
still	5896
if	5896
you	5896
look	5896
at	5896
the	5896
straw	5896
you	5897
can	5897
see	5897
what	5897
the	5897
ear	5897
was	5897
for	5897
i	5897
have	5897
had	5897
trouble	5897
enough	5897
and	5897
to	5897
spare	5898
mars	5898
and	5898
minerva	5898
made	5898
me	5898
doughty	5898
in	5898
war	5898
when	5898
i	5898
had	5898
picked	5898
my	5899
men	5899
to	5899
surprise	5899
the	5899
enemy	5899
with	5899
an	5899
ambuscade	5899
i	5899
never	5899
gave	5899
death	5899
so	5900
much	5900
as	5900
a	5900
thought	5900
but	5900
was	5900
the	5900
first	5900
to	5900
leap	5900
forward	5900
and	5900
spear	5900
all	5901
whom	5901
i	5901
could	5901
overtake	5901
such	5901
was	5901
i	5901
in	5901
battle	5901
but	5901
i	5901
did	5901
not	5901
care	5901
about	5902
farm	5902
work	5902
nor	5902
the	5902
frugal	5902
home	5902
life	5902
of	5902
those	5902
who	5902
would	5902
bring	5902
up	5903
children	5903
my	5903
delight	5903
was	5903
in	5903
ships	5903
fighting	5903
javelins	5903
and	5903
arrows	5903
things	5904
that	5904
most	5904
men	5904
shudder	5904
to	5904
think	5904
of	5904
but	5904
one	5904
man	5904
likes	5904
one	5904
thing	5904
and	5905
another	5905
another	5905
and	5905
this	5905
was	5905
what	5905
i	5905
was	5905
most	5905
naturally	5905
inclined	5905
to	5906
before	5906
the	5906
achaeans	5906
went	5906
to	5906
troy	5906
nine	5906
times	5906
was	5906
i	5906
in	5906
command	5906
of	5907
men	5907
and	5907
ships	5907
on	5907
foreign	5907
service	5907
and	5907
i	5907
amassed	5907
much	5907
wealth	5907
i	5907
had	5908
my	5908
pick	5908
of	5908
the	5908
spoil	5908
in	5908
the	5908
first	5908
instance	5908
and	5908
much	5908
more	5908
was	5908
allotted	5909
to	5909
me	5909
later	5909
on	5909
my	5911
house	5911
grew	5911
apace	5911
and	5911
i	5911
became	5911
a	5911
great	5911
man	5911
among	5911
the	5911
cretans	5911
but	5911
when	5912
jove	5912
counselled	5912
that	5912
terrible	5912
expedition	5912
in	5912
which	5912
so	5912
many	5912
perished	5912
the	5913
people	5913
required	5913
me	5913
and	5913
idomeneus	5913
to	5913
lead	5913
their	5913
ships	5913
to	5913
troy	5913
and	5914
there	5914
was	5914
no	5914
way	5914
out	5914
of	5914
it	5914
for	5914
they	5914
insisted	5914
on	5914
our	5914
doing	5914
so	5914
there	5915
we	5915
fought	5915
for	5915
nine	5915
whole	5915
years	5915
but	5915
in	5915
the	5915
tenth	5915
we	5915
sacked	5915
the	5915
city	5916
of	5916
priam	5916
and	5916
sailed	5916
home	5916
again	5916
as	5916
heaven	5916
dispersed	5916
us	5916
then	5916
it	5916
was	5917
that	5917
jove	5917
devised	5917
evil	5917
against	5917
me	5917
i	5917
spent	5917
but	5917
one	5917
month	5917
happily	5917
with	5918
my	5918
children	5918
wife	5918
and	5918
property	5918
and	5918
then	5918
i	5918
conceived	5918
the	5918
idea	5918
of	5919
making	5919
a	5919
descent	5919
on	5919
egypt	5919
so	5919
i	5919
fitted	5919
out	5919
a	5919
fine	5919
fleet	5919
and	5919
manned	5919
it	5920
i	5920
had	5920
nine	5920
ships	5920
and	5920
the	5920
people	5920
flocked	5920
to	5920
fill	5920
them	5920
for	5920
six	5920
days	5921
i	5921
and	5921
my	5921
men	5921
made	5921
feast	5921
and	5921
i	5921
found	5921
them	5921
many	5921
victims	5921
both	5921
for	5921
sacrifice	5922
to	5922
the	5922
gods	5922
and	5922
for	5922
themselves	5922
but	5922
on	5922
the	5922
seventh	5922
day	5922
we	5922
went	5923
on	5923
board	5923
and	5923
set	5923
sail	5923
from	5923
crete	5923
with	5923
a	5923
fair	5923
north	5923
wind	5923
behind	5923
us	5924
though	5924
we	5924
were	5924
going	5924
down	5924
a	5924
river	5924
nothing	5924
went	5924
ill	5924
with	5924
any	5924
of	5924
our	5925
ships	5925
and	5925
we	5925
had	5925
no	5925
sickness	5925
on	5925
board	5925
but	5925
sat	5925
where	5925
we	5925
were	5925
and	5926
let	5926
the	5926
ships	5926
go	5926
as	5926
the	5926
wind	5926
and	5926
steersmen	5926
took	5926
them	5926
on	5926
the	5926
fifth	5926
day	5927
we	5927
reached	5927
the	5927
river	5927
aegyptus	5927
there	5927
i	5927
stationed	5927
my	5927
ships	5927
in	5927
the	5927
river	5928
bidding	5928
my	5928
men	5928
stay	5928
by	5928
them	5928
and	5928
keep	5928
guard	5928
over	5928
them	5928
while	5928
i	5929
sent	5929
out	5929
scouts	5929
to	5929
reconnoitre	5929
from	5929
every	5929
point	5929
of	5929
vantage	5929
but	5931
the	5931
men	5931
disobeyed	5931
my	5931
orders	5931
took	5931
to	5931
their	5931
own	5931
devices	5931
and	5931
ravaged	5931
the	5932
land	5932
of	5932
the	5932
egyptians	5932
killing	5932
the	5932
men	5932
and	5932
taking	5932
their	5932
wives	5932
and	5933
children	5933
captive	5933
the	5933
alarm	5933
was	5933
soon	5933
carried	5933
to	5933
the	5933
city	5933
and	5933
when	5934
they	5934
heard	5934
the	5934
war	5934
cry	5934
the	5934
people	5934
came	5934
out	5934
at	5934
daybreak	5934
till	5934
the	5935
plain	5935
was	5935
filled	5935
with	5935
horsemen	5935
and	5935
foot	5935
soldiers	5935
and	5935
with	5935
the	5935
gleam	5936
of	5936
armour	5936
then	5936
jove	5936
spread	5936
panic	5936
among	5936
my	5936
men	5936
and	5936
they	5936
would	5936
no	5937
longer	5937
face	5937
the	5937
enemy	5937
for	5937
they	5937
found	5937
themselves	5937
surrounded	5937
the	5937
egyptians	5938
killed	5938
many	5938
of	5938
us	5938
and	5938
took	5938
the	5938
rest	5938
alive	5938
to	5938
do	5938
forced	5938
labour	5939
for	5939
them	5939
jove	5939
however	5939
put	5939
it	5939
in	5939
my	5939
mind	5939
to	5939
do	5939
thus	5939
and	5939
i	5940
wish	5940
i	5940
had	5940
died	5940
then	5940
and	5940
there	5940
in	5940
egypt	5940
instead	5940
for	5940
there	5940
was	5940
much	5940
sorrow	5941
in	5941
store	5941
for	5941
me	5941
i	5941
took	5941
off	5941
my	5941
helmet	5941
and	5941
shield	5941
and	5941
dropped	5941
my	5942
spear	5942
from	5942
my	5942
hand	5942
then	5942
i	5942
went	5942
straight	5942
up	5942
to	5942
the	5942
king's	5942
chariot	5942
clasped	5943
his	5943
knees	5943
and	5943
kissed	5943
them	5943
whereon	5943
he	5943
spared	5943
my	5943
life	5943
bade	5943
me	5944
get	5944
into	5944
his	5944
chariot	5944
and	5944
took	5944
me	5944
weeping	5944
to	5944
his	5944
own	5944
home	5944
many	5944
made	5945
at	5945
me	5945
with	5945
their	5945
ashen	5945
spears	5945
and	5945
tried	5945
to	5945
kil	5945
me	5945
in	5945
their	5945
fury	5945
but	5946
the	5946
king	5946
protected	5946
me	5946
for	5946
he	5946
feared	5946
the	5946
wrath	5946
of	5946
jove	5946
the	5946
protector	5946
of	5947
strangers	5947
who	5947
punishes	5947
those	5947
who	5947
do	5947
evil	5947
i	5949
stayed	5949
there	5949
for	5949
seven	5949
years	5949
and	5949
got	5949
together	5949
much	5949
money	5949
among	5949
the	5950
egyptians	5950
for	5950
they	5950
all	5950
gave	5950
me	5950
something	5950
but	5950
when	5950
it	5950
was	5950
now	5950
going	5951
on	5951
for	5951
eight	5951
years	5951
there	5951
came	5951
a	5951
certain	5951
phoenician	5951
a	5951
cunning	5951
rascal	5952
who	5952
had	5952
already	5952
committed	5952
all	5952
sorts	5952
of	5952
villainy	5952
and	5952
this	5952
man	5953
talked	5953
me	5953
over	5953
into	5953
going	5953
with	5953
him	5953
to	5953
phoenicia	5953
where	5953
his	5953
house	5953
and	5954
his	5954
possessions	5954
lay	5954
i	5954
stayed	5954
there	5954
for	5954
a	5954
whole	5954
twelve	5954
months	5954
but	5955
at	5955
the	5955
end	5955
of	5955
that	5955
time	5955
when	5955
months	5955
and	5955
days	5955
had	5955
gone	5955
by	5955
till	5955
the	5956
same	5956
season	5956
had	5956
come	5956
round	5956
again	5956
he	5956
set	5956
me	5956
on	5956
board	5956
a	5956
ship	5956
bound	5956
for	5957
libya	5957
on	5957
a	5957
pretence	5957
that	5957
i	5957
was	5957
to	5957
take	5957
a	5957
cargo	5957
along	5957
with	5957
him	5957
to	5958
that	5958
place	5958
but	5958
really	5958
that	5958
he	5958
might	5958
sell	5958
me	5958
as	5958
a	5958
slave	5958
and	5958
take	5958
the	5959
money	5959
i	5959
fetched	5959
i	5959
suspected	5959
his	5959
intention	5959
but	5959
went	5959
on	5959
board	5959
with	5960
him	5960
for	5960
i	5960
could	5960
not	5960
help	5960
it	5960
the	5962
ship	5962
ran	5962
before	5962
a	5962
fresh	5962
north	5962
wind	5962
till	5962
we	5962
had	5962
reached	5962
the	5962
sea	5962
that	5963
lies	5963
between	5963
crete	5963
and	5963
libya	5963
there	5963
however	5963
jove	5963
counselled	5963
their	5964
destruction	5964
for	5964
as	5964
soon	5964
as	5964
we	5964
were	5964
well	5964
out	5964
from	5964
crete	5964
and	5964
could	5965
see	5965
nothing	5965
but	5965
sea	5965
and	5965
sky	5965
he	5965
raised	5965
a	5965
black	5965
cloud	5965
over	5965
our	5965
ship	5966
and	5966
the	5966
sea	5966
grew	5966
dark	5966
beneath	5966
it	5966
then	5966
jove	5966
let	5966
fly	5966
with	5966
his	5966
thunderbolts	5967
and	5967
the	5967
ship	5967
went	5967
round	5967
and	5967
round	5967
and	5967
was	5967
filled	5967
with	5967
fire	5968
and	5968
brimstone	5968
as	5968
the	5968
lightning	5968
struck	5968
it	5968
the	5968
men	5968
fell	5968
all	5968
into	5968
the	5969
sea	5969
they	5969
were	5969
carried	5969
about	5969
in	5969
the	5969
water	5969
round	5969
the	5969
ship	5969
looking	5969
like	5970
so	5970
many	5970
sea-gulls	5970
but	5970
the	5970
god	5970
presently	5970
deprived	5970
them	5970
of	5970
all	5970
chance	5971
of	5971
getting	5971
home	5971
again	5971
i	5971
was	5971
all	5971
dismayed	5971
jove	5971
however	5971
sent	5971
the	5972
ship's	5972
mast	5972
within	5972
my	5972
reach	5972
which	5972
saved	5972
my	5972
life	5972
for	5972
i	5972
clung	5972
to	5973
it	5973
and	5973
drifted	5973
before	5973
the	5973
fury	5973
of	5973
the	5973
gale	5973
nine	5973
days	5973
did	5973
i	5973
drift	5973
but	5974
in	5974
the	5974
darkness	5974
of	5974
the	5974
tenth	5974
night	5974
a	5974
great	5974
wave	5974
bore	5974
me	5974
on	5974
to	5974
the	5975
thesprotian	5975
coast	5975
there	5975
pheidon	5975
king	5975
of	5975
the	5975
thesprotians	5975
entertained	5975
me	5976
hospitably	5976
without	5976
charging	5976
me	5976
anything	5976
at	5976
all	5976
for	5976
his	5976
son	5976
found	5976
me	5977
when	5977
i	5977
was	5977
nearly	5977
dead	5977
with	5977
cold	5977
and	5977
fatigue	5977
whereon	5977
he	5977
raised	5977
me	5978
by	5978
the	5978
hand	5978
took	5978
me	5978
to	5978
his	5978
father's	5978
house	5978
and	5978
gave	5978
me	5978
clothes	5978
to	5979
wear	5979
there	5981
it	5981
was	5981
that	5981
i	5981
heard	5981
news	5981
of	5981
ulysses	5981
for	5981
the	5981
king	5981
told	5981
me	5981
he	5981
had	5982
entertained	5982
him	5982
and	5982
shown	5982
him	5982
much	5982
hospitality	5982
while	5982
he	5982
was	5982
on	5982
his	5983
homeward	5983
journey	5983
he	5983
showed	5983
me	5983
also	5983
the	5983
treasure	5983
of	5983
gold	5983
and	5983
wrought	5984
iron	5984
that	5984
ulysses	5984
had	5984
got	5984
together	5984
there	5984
was	5984
enough	5984
to	5984
keep	5984
his	5985
family	5985
for	5985
ten	5985
generations	5985
so	5985
much	5985
had	5985
he	5985
left	5985
in	5985
the	5985
house	5985
of	5985
king	5986
pheidon	5986
but	5986
the	5986
king	5986
said	5986
ulysses	5986
had	5986
gone	5986
to	5986
dodona	5986
that	5986
he	5986
might	5987
learn	5987
jove's	5987
mind	5987
from	5987
the	5987
god's	5987
high	5987
oak	5987
tree	5987
and	5987
know	5987
whether	5987
after	5988
so	5988
long	5988
an	5988
absence	5988
he	5988
should	5988
return	5988
to	5988
ithaca	5988
openly	5988
or	5988
in	5988
secret	5989
moreover	5989
the	5989
king	5989
swore	5989
in	5989
my	5989
presence	5989
making	5989
drink-offerings	5989
in	5990
his	5990
own	5990
house	5990
as	5990
he	5990
did	5990
so	5990
that	5990
the	5990
ship	5990
was	5990
by	5990
the	5990
water	5990
side	5990
and	5991
the	5991
crew	5991
found	5991
that	5991
should	5991
take	5991
him	5991
to	5991
his	5991
own	5991
country	5991
he	5991
sent	5991
me	5992
off	5992
however	5992
before	5992
ulysses	5992
returned	5992
for	5992
there	5992
happened	5992
to	5992
be	5992
a	5992
thesprotian	5993
ship	5993
sailing	5993
for	5993
the	5993
wheat-growing	5993
island	5993
of	5993
dulichium	5993
and	5994
he	5994
told	5994
those	5994
in	5994
charge	5994
of	5994
her	5994
to	5994
be	5994
sure	5994
and	5994
take	5994
me	5994
safely	5994
to	5994
king	5995
acastus	5995
these	5997
men	5997
hatched	5997
a	5997
plot	5997
against	5997
me	5997
that	5997
would	5997
have	5997
reduced	5997
me	5997
to	5997
the	5998
very	5998
extreme	5998
of	5998
misery	5998
for	5998
when	5998
the	5998
ship	5998
had	5998
got	5998
some	5998
way	5998
out	5998
from	5999
land	5999
they	5999
resolved	5999
on	5999
selling	5999
me	5999
as	5999
a	5999
slave	5999
they	5999
stripped	5999
me	5999
of	6000
the	6000
shirt	6000
and	6000
cloak	6000
that	6000
i	6000
was	6000
wearing	6000
and	6000
gave	6000
me	6000
instead	6000
the	6000
tattered	6001
old	6001
clouts	6001
in	6001
which	6001
you	6001
now	6001
see	6001
me	6001
then	6001
towards	6001
nightfall	6001
they	6002
reached	6002
the	6002
tilled	6002
lands	6002
of	6002
ithaca	6002
and	6002
there	6002
they	6002
bound	6002
me	6002
with	6002
a	6003
strong	6003
rope	6003
fast	6003
in	6003
the	6003
ship	6003
while	6003
they	6003
went	6003
on	6003
shore	6003
to	6003
get	6003
supper	6003
by	6004
the	6004
sea	6004
side	6004
but	6004
the	6004
gods	6004
soon	6004
undid	6004
my	6004
bonds	6004
for	6004
me	6004
and	6004
having	6004
drawn	6005
my	6005
rags	6005
over	6005
my	6005
head	6005
i	6005
slid	6005
down	6005
the	6005
rudder	6005
into	6005
the	6005
sea	6005
where	6005
i	6006
struck	6006
out	6006
and	6006
swam	6006
till	6006
i	6006
was	6006
well	6006
clear	6006
of	6006
them	6006
and	6006
came	6006
ashore	6006
near	6007
a	6007
thick	6007
wood	6007
in	6007
which	6007
i	6007
lay	6007
concealed	6007
they	6007
were	6007
very	6007
angry	6007
at	6007
my	6008
having	6008
escaped	6008
and	6008
went	6008
searching	6008
about	6008
for	6008
me	6008
till	6008
at	6008
last	6008
they	6008
thought	6009
it	6009
was	6009
no	6009
further	6009
use	6009
and	6009
went	6009
back	6009
to	6009
their	6009
ship	6009
the	6009
gods	6009
having	6010
hidden	6010
me	6010
thus	6010
easily	6010
then	6010
took	6010
me	6010
to	6010
a	6010
good	6010
man's	6010
door	6010
for	6010
it	6011
seems	6011
that	6011
i	6011
am	6011
not	6011
to	6011
die	6011
yet	6011
awhile	6011
to	6013
this	6013
you	6013
answered	6013
o	6013
swineherd	6013
eumaeus	6013
poor	6013
unhappy	6013
stranger	6013
i	6014
have	6014
found	6014
the	6014
story	6014
of	6014
your	6014
misfortunes	6014
extremely	6014
interesting	6014
but	6015
that	6015
part	6015
about	6015
ulysses	6015
is	6015
not	6015
right	6015
and	6015
you	6015
will	6015
never	6015
get	6015
me	6015
to	6016
believe	6016
it	6016
why	6016
should	6016
a	6016
man	6016
like	6016
you	6016
go	6016
about	6016
telling	6016
lies	6016
in	6016
this	6017
way	6017
i	6017
know	6017
all	6017
about	6017
the	6017
return	6017
of	6017
my	6017
master	6017
the	6017
gods	6017
one	6017
and	6017
all	6018
of	6018
them	6018
detest	6018
him	6018
or	6018
they	6018
would	6018
have	6018
taken	6018
him	6018
before	6018
troy	6018
or	6019
let	6019
him	6019
die	6019
with	6019
friends	6019
around	6019
him	6019
when	6019
the	6019
days	6019
of	6019
his	6019
fighting	6019
were	6020
done	6020
for	6020
then	6020
the	6020
achaeans	6020
would	6020
have	6020
built	6020
a	6020
mound	6020
over	6020
his	6020
ashes	6021
and	6021
his	6021
son	6021
would	6021
have	6021
been	6021
heir	6021
to	6021
his	6021
renown	6021
but	6021
now	6021
the	6021
storm	6022
winds	6022
have	6022
spirited	6022
him	6022
away	6022
we	6022
know	6022
not	6022
whither	6022
as	6024
for	6024
me	6024
i	6024
live	6024
out	6024
of	6024
the	6024
way	6024
here	6024
with	6024
the	6024
pigs	6024
and	6024
never	6024
go	6024
to	6025
the	6025
town	6025
unless	6025
when	6025
penelope	6025
sends	6025
for	6025
me	6025
on	6025
the	6025
arrival	6025
of	6025
some	6025
news	6026
about	6026
ulysses	6026
then	6026
they	6026
all	6026
sit	6026
round	6026
and	6026
ask	6026
questions	6026
both	6026
those	6027
who	6027
grieve	6027
over	6027
the	6027
king's	6027
absence	6027
and	6027
those	6027
who	6027
rejoice	6027
at	6027
it	6028
because	6028
they	6028
can	6028
eat	6028
up	6028
his	6028
property	6028
without	6028
paying	6028
for	6028
it	6028
for	6028
my	6029
own	6029
part	6029
i	6029
have	6029
never	6029
cared	6029
about	6029
asking	6029
anyone	6029
else	6029
since	6029
the	6029
time	6030
when	6030
i	6030
was	6030
taken	6030
in	6030
by	6030
an	6030
aetolian	6030
who	6030
had	6030
killed	6030
a	6030
man	6030
and	6030
come	6031
a	6031
long	6031
way	6031
till	6031
at	6031
last	6031
he	6031
reached	6031
my	6031
station	6031
and	6031
i	6031
was	6031
very	6031
kind	6032
to	6032
him	6032
he	6032
said	6032
he	6032
had	6032
seen	6032
ulysses	6032
with	6032
idomeneus	6032
among	6032
the	6032
cretans	6033
refitting	6033
his	6033
ships	6033
which	6033
had	6033
been	6033
damaged	6033
in	6033
a	6033
gale	6033

ulysses	6034

return	6034
in	6034
the	6034
following	6034
summer	6034
or	6034
autumn	6034
with	6034
his	6034
men	6035
and	6035
that	6035
he	6035
would	6035
bring	6035
back	6035
much	6035
wealth	6035
and	6035
now	6035
you	6035
you	6035
unfortunate	6035
old	6036
man	6036
since	6036
fate	6036
has	6036
brought	6036
you	6036
to	6036
my	6036
door	6036
do	6036
not	6036
try	6036
to	6036
flatter	6036
me	6037
in	6037
this	6037
way	6037
with	6037
vain	6037
hopes	6037
it	6037
is	6037
not	6037
for	6037
any	6037
such	6037
reason	6037
that	6037
i	6038
shall	6038
treat	6038
you	6038
kindly	6038
but	6038
only	6038
out	6038
of	6038
respect	6038
for	6038
jove	6038
the	6038
god	6038
of	6039
hospitality	6039
as	6039
fearing	6039
him	6039
and	6039
pitying	6039
you	6039
ulysses	6041
answered	6041
i	6041
see	6041
that	6041
you	6041
are	6041
of	6041
an	6041
unbelieving	6041
mind	6041
i	6041
have	6041
given	6042
you	6042
my	6042
oath	6042
and	6042
yet	6042
you	6042
will	6042
not	6042
credit	6042
me	6042
let	6042
us	6042
then	6042
make	6042
a	6043
bargain	6043
and	6043
call	6043
all	6043
the	6043
gods	6043
in	6043
heaven	6043
to	6043
witness	6043
it	6043
if	6043
your	6043
master	6044
comes	6044
home	6044
give	6044
me	6044
a	6044
cloak	6044
and	6044
shirt	6044
of	6044
good	6044
wear	6044
and	6044
send	6044
me	6045
to	6045
dulichium	6045
where	6045
i	6045
want	6045
to	6045
go	6045
but	6045
if	6045
he	6045
does	6045
not	6045
come	6045
as	6045
i	6045
say	6045
he	6046
will	6046
set	6046
your	6046
men	6046
on	6046
to	6046
me	6046
and	6046
tell	6046
them	6046
to	6046
throw	6046
me	6046
from	6046
yonder	6046
precepice	6047
as	6047
a	6047
warning	6047
to	6047
tramps	6047
not	6047
to	6047
go	6047
about	6047
the	6047
country	6047
telling	6047
lies	6048
and	6050
a	6050
pretty	6050
figure	6050
i	6050
should	6050
cut	6050
then	6050
replied	6050
eumaeus	6050
both	6050
now	6050
and	6051
hereafter	6051
if	6051
i	6051
were	6051
to	6051
kill	6051
you	6051
after	6051
receiving	6051
you	6051
into	6051
my	6051
hut	6051
and	6052
showing	6052
you	6052
hospitality	6052
i	6052
should	6052
have	6052
to	6052
say	6052
my	6052
prayers	6052
in	6052
good	6052
earnest	6053
if	6053
i	6053
did	6053
but	6053
it	6053
is	6053
just	6053
supper	6053
time	6053
and	6053
i	6053
hope	6053
my	6053
men	6053
will	6053
come	6054
in	6054
directly	6054
that	6054
we	6054
may	6054
cook	6054
something	6054
savoury	6054
for	6054
supper	6054
thus	6056
did	6056
they	6056
converse	6056
and	6056
presently	6056
the	6056
swineherds	6056
came	6056
up	6056
with	6056
the	6057
pigs	6057
which	6057
were	6057
then	6057
shut	6057
up	6057
for	6057
the	6057
night	6057
in	6057
their	6057
sties	6057
and	6057
a	6058
tremendous	6058
squealing	6058
they	6058
made	6058
as	6058
they	6058
were	6058
being	6058
driven	6058
into	6058
them	6058
but	6059
eumaeus	6059
called	6059
to	6059
his	6059
men	6059
and	6059
said	6059
bring	6059
in	6059
the	6059
best	6059
pig	6059
you	6059
have	6060
that	6060
i	6060
may	6060
sacrifice	6060
for	6060
this	6060
stranger	6060
and	6060
we	6060
will	6060
take	6060
toll	6060
of	6061
him	6061
ourselves	6061
we	6061
have	6061
had	6061
trouble	6061
enough	6061
this	6061
long	6061
time	6061
feeding	6061
pigs	6062
while	6062
others	6062
reap	6062
the	6062
fruit	6062
of	6062
our	6062
labour	6062
on	6064
this	6064
he	6064
began	6064
chopping	6064
firewood	6064
while	6064
the	6064
others	6064
brought	6064
in	6064
a	6064
fine	6065
fat	6065
five	6065
year	6065
old	6065
boar	6065
pig	6065
and	6065
set	6065
it	6065
at	6065
the	6065
altar	6065
eumaeus	6065
did	6066
not	6066
forget	6066
the	6066
gods	6066
for	6066
he	6066
was	6066
a	6066
man	6066
of	6066
good	6066
principles	6066
so	6066
the	6066
first	6067
thing	6067
he	6067
did	6067
was	6067
to	6067
cut	6067
bristles	6067
from	6067
the	6067
pig's	6067
face	6067
and	6067
throw	6067
them	6068
into	6068
the	6068
fire	6068
praying	6068
to	6068
all	6068
the	6068
gods	6068
as	6068
he	6068
did	6068
so	6068
that	6068
ulysses	6068
might	6069
return	6069
home	6069
again	6069
then	6069
he	6069
clubbed	6069
the	6069
pig	6069
with	6069
a	6069
billet	6069
of	6069
oak	6070
which	6070
he	6070
had	6070
kept	6070
back	6070
when	6070
he	6070
was	6070
chopping	6070
the	6070
firewood	6070
and	6070
stunned	6071
it	6071
while	6071
the	6071
others	6071
slaughtered	6071
and	6071
singed	6071
it	6071
then	6071
they	6071
cut	6072
it	6072
up	6072
and	6072
eumaeus	6072
began	6072
by	6072
putting	6072
raw	6072
pieces	6072
from	6072
each	6072
joint	6072
on	6073
to	6073
some	6073
of	6073
the	6073
fat	6073
these	6073
he	6073
sprinkled	6073
with	6073
barley	6073
meal	6073
and	6073
laid	6073
upon	6074
the	6074
embers	6074
they	6074
cut	6074
the	6074
rest	6074
of	6074
the	6074
meat	6074
up	6074
small	6074
put	6074
the	6074
pieces	6074
upon	6075
the	6075
spits	6075
and	6075
roasted	6075
them	6075
till	6075
they	6075
were	6075
done	6075
when	6075
they	6075
had	6075
taken	6076
them	6076
off	6076
the	6076
spits	6076
they	6076
threw	6076
them	6076
on	6076
to	6076
the	6076
dresser	6076
in	6076
a	6076
heap	6076
the	6077
swineherd	6077
who	6077
was	6077
a	6077
most	6077
equitable	6077
man	6077
then	6077
stood	6077
up	6077
to	6077
give	6077
every	6078
one	6078
his	6078
share	6078
he	6078
made	6078
seven	6078
portions	6078
one	6078
of	6078
these	6078
he	6078
set	6078
apart	6078
for	6079
mercury	6079
the	6079
son	6079
of	6079
maia	6079
and	6079
the	6079
nymphs	6079
praying	6079
to	6079
them	6079
as	6079
he	6079
did	6080
so	6080
the	6080
others	6080
he	6080
dealt	6080
out	6080
to	6080
the	6080
men	6080
man	6080
by	6080
man	6080
he	6080
gave	6080
ulysses	6080
some	6081
slices	6081
cut	6081
lengthways	6081
down	6081
the	6081
loin	6081
as	6081
a	6081
mark	6081
of	6081
especial	6081
honour	6081
and	6082
ulysses	6082
was	6082
much	6082
pleased	6082
i	6082
hope	6082
eumaeus	6082
said	6082
he	6082
that	6082
jove	6082
will	6083
be	6083
as	6083
well	6083
disposed	6083
towards	6083
you	6083
as	6083
i	6083
am	6083
for	6083
the	6083
respect	6083
you	6083
are	6084
showing	6084
to	6084
an	6084
outcast	6084
like	6084
myself	6084
to	6086
this	6086
you	6086
answered	6086
o	6086
swineherd	6086
eumaeus	6086
eat	6086
my	6086
good	6086
fellow	6086
and	6086
enjoy	6087
your	6087
supper	6087
such	6087
as	6087
it	6087
is	6087
god	6087
grants	6087
this	6087
and	6087
withholds	6087
that	6087
just	6088
as	6088
he	6088
thinks	6088
right	6088
for	6088
he	6088
can	6088
do	6088
whatever	6088
he	6088
chooses	6088
as	6090
he	6090
spoke	6090
he	6090
cut	6090
off	6090
the	6090
first	6090
piece	6090
and	6090
offered	6090
it	6090
as	6090
a	6090
burnt	6090
sacrifice	6090
to	6091
the	6091
immortal	6091
gods	6091
then	6091
he	6091
made	6091
them	6091
a	6091
drink-offering	6091
put	6091
the	6091
cup	6092
in	6092
the	6092
hands	6092
of	6092
ulysses	6092
and	6092
sat	6092
down	6092
to	6092
his	6092
own	6092
portion	6092
mesaulius	6092
brought	6093
them	6093
their	6093
bread	6093
the	6093
swineherd	6093
had	6093
bought	6093
this	6093
man	6093
on	6093
his	6093
own	6094
account	6094
from	6094
among	6094
the	6094
taphians	6094
during	6094
his	6094
master's	6094
absence	6094
and	6094
had	6095
paid	6095
for	6095
him	6095
with	6095
his	6095
own	6095
money	6095
without	6095
saying	6095
anything	6095
either	6095
to	6096
his	6096
mistress	6096
or	6096
laertes	6096
they	6096
then	6096
laid	6096
their	6096
hands	6096
upon	6096
the	6096
good	6096
things	6097
that	6097
were	6097
before	6097
them	6097
and	6097
when	6097
they	6097
had	6097
had	6097
enough	6097
to	6097
eat	6097
and	6098
drink	6098
mesaulius	6098
took	6098
away	6098
what	6098
was	6098
left	6098
of	6098
the	6098
bread	6098
and	6098
they	6098
all	6099
went	6099
to	6099
bed	6099
after	6099
having	6099
made	6099
a	6099
hearty	6099
supper	6099
now	6101
the	6101
night	6101
came	6101
on	6101
stormy	6101
and	6101
very	6101
dark	6101
for	6101
there	6101
was	6101
no	6101
moon	6101
it	6102
poured	6102
without	6102
ceasing	6102
and	6102
the	6102
wind	6102
blew	6102
strong	6102
from	6102
the	6102
west	6102
which	6103
is	6103
a	6103
wet	6103
quarter	6103
so	6103
ulysses	6103
thought	6103
he	6103
would	6103
see	6103
whether	6103
eumaeus	6103
in	6104
the	6104
excellent	6104
care	6104
he	6104
took	6104
of	6104
him	6104
would	6104
take	6104
off	6104
his	6104
own	6104
cloak	6104
and	6105
give	6105
it	6105
him	6105
or	6105
make	6105
one	6105
of	6105
his	6105
men	6105
give	6105
him	6105
one	6105
listen	6105
to	6105
me	6105
said	6106
he	6106
eumaeus	6106
and	6106
the	6106
rest	6106
of	6106
you	6106
when	6106
i	6106
have	6106
said	6106
a	6106
prayer	6106
i	6106
will	6107
tell	6107
you	6107
something	6107
it	6107
is	6107
the	6107
wine	6107
that	6107
makes	6107
me	6107
talk	6107
in	6107
this	6107
way	6108
wine	6108
will	6108
make	6108
even	6108
a	6108
wise	6108
man	6108
fall	6108
to	6108
singing	6108
it	6108
will	6108
make	6108
him	6109
chuckle	6109
and	6109
dance	6109
and	6109
say	6109
many	6109
a	6109
word	6109
that	6109
he	6109
had	6109
better	6109
leave	6109
unspoken	6110
still	6110
as	6110
i	6110
have	6110
begun	6110
i	6110
will	6110
go	6110
on	6110
would	6110
that	6110
i	6110
were	6110
still	6111
young	6111
and	6111
strong	6111
as	6111
when	6111
we	6111
got	6111
up	6111
an	6111
ambuscade	6111
before	6111
troy	6111
menelaus	6112
and	6112
ulysses	6112
were	6112
the	6112
leaders	6112
but	6112
i	6112
was	6112
in	6112
command	6112
also	6112
for	6113
the	6113
other	6113
two	6113
would	6113
have	6113
it	6113
so	6113
when	6113
we	6113
had	6113
come	6113
up	6113
to	6113
the	6113
wall	6113
of	6114
the	6114
city	6114
we	6114
crouched	6114
down	6114
beneath	6114
our	6114
armour	6114
and	6114
lay	6114
there	6114
under	6114
cover	6115
of	6115
the	6115
reeds	6115
and	6115
thick	6115
brush-wood	6115
that	6115
grew	6115
about	6115
the	6115
swamp	6115
it	6116
came	6116
on	6116
to	6116
freeze	6116
with	6116
a	6116
north	6116
wind	6116
blowing	6116
the	6116
snow	6116
fell	6116
small	6116
and	6117
fine	6117
like	6117
hoar	6117
frost	6117
and	6117
our	6117
shields	6117
were	6117
coated	6117
thick	6117
with	6117
rime	6117
the	6118
others	6118

carelessly	6119
left	6119
my	6120

thinking	6120
that	6120
i	6120

be	6120
too	6120
cold	6120
and	6120
had	6120

in	6121
nothing	6121
but	6121
my	6121
shirt	6121
and	6121

when	6121
the	6121

was	6123
close	6123
to	6123
me	6123
with	6123
my	6123

and	6123
he	6123
at	6123
once	6123
gave	6123
me	6123
his	6123
ear	6123
ulysses	6125
said	6125
i	6125
this	6125
cold	6125
will	6125
be	6125
the	6125
death	6125
of	6125

for	6125
i	6125

no	6126

me	6126
into	6126
setting	6126
off	6126
with	6126
nothing	6126
on	6126
but	6126
my	6127

in	6132
a	6132
low	6132
voice	6132
or	6132
the	6132
others	6132
will	6132
hear	6132
you	6132
then	6133
he	6133
raised	6133
his	6133
head	6133
on	6133
his	6133
elbow	6133
my	6135
friends	6135

he	6135
i	6135
have	6135
had	6135
a	6135
dream	6135
from	6135
heaven	6135
in	6135
my	6135
sleep	6135
we	6136
are	6136
a	6136
long	6136
way	6136
from	6136
the	6136
ships	6136
i	6136
wish	6136
some	6136
one	6136
would	6136
go	6136
down	6136
and	6136
tell	6137
agamemnon	6137
to	6137
send	6137
us	6137
up	6137
more	6137
men	6137
at	6137
once	6137
on	6139
this	6139
thoas	6139
son	6139
of	6139
andraemon	6139
threw	6139
off	6139
his	6139
cloak	6139
and	6139
set	6139
out	6139
running	6139
to	6140
the	6140
ships	6140
whereon	6140
i	6140
took	6140
the	6140
cloak	6140
and	6140
lay	6140
in	6140
it	6140
comfortably	6140
enough	6140
till	6141
morning	6141
would	6141
that	6141
i	6141
were	6141
still	6141
young	6141
and	6141
strong	6141
as	6141
i	6141
was	6141
in	6141
those	6142
days	6142
for	6142
then	6142
some	6142
one	6142
of	6142
you	6142
swineherds	6142
would	6142
give	6142
me	6142
a	6142
cloak	6142
both	6143
out	6143
of	6143
good	6143
will	6143
and	6143
for	6143
the	6143
respect	6143
due	6143
to	6143
a	6143
brave	6143
soldier	6143
but	6144
now	6144
people	6144
look	6144
down	6144
upon	6144
me	6144
because	6144
my	6144
clothes	6144
are	6144
shabby	6144
and	6146
eumaeus	6146
answered	6146
old	6146
man	6146
you	6146
have	6146
told	6146
us	6146
an	6146
excellent	6146
story	6146
and	6147
have	6147
said	6147
nothing	6147
so	6147
far	6147
but	6147
what	6147
is	6147
quite	6147
satisfactory	6147
for	6147
the	6147
present	6148
therefore	6148
you	6148
shall	6148
want	6148
neither	6148
clothing	6148
nor	6148
anything	6148
else	6148
that	6149
a	6149
stranger	6149
in	6149
distress	6149
may	6149
reasonably	6149
expect	6149
but	6149
to-morrow	6149
morning	6149
you	6150
have	6150
to	6150
shake	6150
your	6150
own	6150
old	6150
rags	6150
about	6150
your	6150
body	6150
again	6150
for	6150
we	6150
have	6151
not	6151
many	6151
spare	6151
cloaks	6151
nor	6151
shirts	6151
up	6151
here	6151
but	6151
every	6151
man	6151
has	6151
only	6151
one	6152
when	6152
ulysses	6152
son	6152
comes	6152
home	6152
again	6152
he	6152
will	6152
give	6152
you	6152
both	6152
cloak	6152
and	6153
shirt	6153
and	6153
send	6153
you	6153
wherever	6153
you	6153
may	6153
want	6153
to	6153
go	6153
with	6155
this	6155
he	6155
got	6155
up	6155
and	6155
made	6155
a	6155
bed	6155
for	6155
ulysses	6155
by	6155
throwing	6155
some	6155
goatskins	6155
and	6156
sheepskins	6156
on	6156
the	6156
ground	6156
in	6156
front	6156
of	6156
the	6156
fire	6156
here	6156
ulysses	6156
lay	6156
down	6157
and	6157
eumaeus	6157
covered	6157
him	6157
over	6157
with	6157
a	6157
great	6157
heavy	6157
cloak	6157
that	6157
he	6157
kept	6158
for	6158
a	6158
change	6158
in	6158
case	6158
of	6158
extraordinarily	6158
bad	6158
weather	6158
thus	6160
did	6160
ulysses	6160
sleep	6160
and	6160
the	6160
young	6160
men	6160
slept	6160
beside	6160
him	6160
but	6160
the	6160
swineherd	6161
did	6161
not	6161
like	6161
sleeping	6161
away	6161
from	6161
his	6161
pigs	6161
so	6161
he	6161
got	6161
ready	6161
to	6162
go	6162
and	6162
ulysses	6162
was	6162
glad	6162
to	6162
see	6162
that	6162
he	6162
looked	6162
after	6162
his	6162
property	6162
during	6163
his	6163
master's	6163
absence	6163
first	6163
he	6163
slung	6163
his	6163
sword	6163
over	6163
his	6163
brawny	6163
shoulders	6164
and	6164
put	6164
on	6164
a	6164
thick	6164
cloak	6164
to	6164
keep	6164
out	6164
the	6164
wind	6164
he	6164
also	6164
took	6164
the	6165
skin	6165
of	6165
a	6165
large	6165
and	6165
well	6165
fed	6165
goat	6165
and	6165
a	6165
javelin	6165
in	6165
case	6165
of	6165
attack	6165
from	6166
men	6166
or	6166
dogs	6166
thus	6166
equipped	6166
he	6166
went	6166
to	6166
his	6166
rest	6166
where	6166
the	6166
pigs	6166
were	6167
camping	6167
under	6167
an	6167
overhanging	6167
rock	6167
that	6167
gave	6167
them	6167
shelter	6167
from	6167
the	6168
north	6168
wind	6168
book	6172
xv	6172
but	6174
minerva	6174
went	6174
to	6174
the	6174
fair	6174
city	6174
of	6174
lacedaemon	6174
to	6174
tell	6174
ulysses	6174
son	6175
that	6175
he	6175
was	6175
to	6175
return	6175
at	6175
once	6175
she	6175
found	6175
him	6175
and	6175
pisistratus	6175
sleeping	6175
in	6176
the	6176
forecourt	6176
of	6176
menelaus's	6176
house	6176
pisistratus	6176
was	6176
fast	6176
asleep	6176
but	6177
telemachus	6177
could	6177
get	6177
no	6177
rest	6177
all	6177
night	6177
for	6177
thinking	6177
of	6177
his	6177
unhappy	6177
father	6178
so	6178
minerva	6178
went	6178
close	6178
up	6178
to	6178
him	6178
and	6178
said	6178
telemachus	6180
you	6180
should	6180
not	6180
remain	6180
so	6180
far	6180
away	6180
from	6180
home	6180
any	6180
longer	6180
nor	6181
leave	6181
your	6181
property	6181
with	6181
such	6181
dangerous	6181
people	6181
in	6181
your	6181
house	6181
they	6182
will	6182
eat	6182
up	6182
everything	6182
you	6182
have	6182
among	6182
them	6182
and	6182
you	6182
will	6182
have	6182
been	6183
on	6183
a	6183
fool's	6183
errand	6183
ask	6183
menelaus	6183
to	6183
send	6183
you	6183
home	6183
at	6183
once	6183
if	6183
you	6184
wish	6184
to	6184
find	6184
your	6184
excellent	6184
mother	6184
still	6184
there	6184
when	6184
you	6184
get	6184
back	6184
her	6185
father	6185
and	6185
brothers	6185
are	6185
already	6185
urging	6185
her	6185
to	6185
marry	6185
eurymachus	6185
who	6186
has	6186
given	6186
her	6186
more	6186
than	6186
any	6186
of	6186
the	6186
others	6186
and	6186
has	6186
been	6186
greatly	6186
increasing	6187
his	6187
wedding	6187
presents	6187
i	6187
hope	6187
nothing	6187
valuable	6187
may	6187
have	6187
been	6188
taken	6188
from	6188
the	6188
house	6188
in	6188
spite	6188
of	6188
you	6188
but	6188
you	6188
know	6188
what	6188
women	6188
are	6189
they	6189
always	6189
want	6189
to	6189
do	6189
the	6189
best	6189
they	6189
can	6189
for	6189
the	6189
man	6189
who	6189
marries	6189
them	6190
and	6190
never	6190
give	6190
another	6190
thought	6190
to	6190
the	6190
children	6190
of	6190
their	6190
first	6190
husband	6191
nor	6191
to	6191
their	6191

is	6191
dead	6191
and	6191
done	6191
with	6191
go	6192
home	6192
therefore	6192
and	6192
put	6192
everything	6192
in	6192
charge	6192
of	6192
the	6192
most	6192
respectable	6192
woman	6193

they	6196
mean	6196
to	6197
kill	6197
you	6197
before	6197
you	6197
can	6197
reach	6197
home	6197

much	6197
think	6197
they	6197
will	6197
succeed	6198
it	6198
is	6198
more	6198
likely	6198
that	6198
some	6198
of	6198
those	6198

now	6198
eating	6198

and	6202
men	6202
on	6202
to	6202
the	6202

yourself	6202
go	6202
straight	6202
to	6203

is	6203
well	6203
disposed	6203
towards	6203

then	6207
she	6207
went	6207
back	6207
to	6207

but	6207
telemachus	6207

pisistratus	6207
with	6208
his	6208

to	6208
rouse	6208
him	6208

way	6214
so	6214
long	6214
as	6214
he	6214
lives	6214
a	6214
guest	6214
should	6214
never	6214
forget	6214
a	6215
host	6215
who	6215
has	6215
shown	6215
him	6215
kindness	6215
as	6217
he	6217
spoke	6217
day	6217
began	6217
to	6217
break	6217
and	6217
menelaus	6217
who	6217
had	6217
already	6217
risen	6217
leaving	6218
helen	6218
in	6218
bed	6218
came	6218
towards	6218
them	6218
when	6218
telemachus	6218
saw	6218
him	6218
he	6218
put	6219
on	6219
his	6219
shirt	6219
as	6219
fast	6219
as	6219
he	6219
could	6219
threw	6219
a	6219
great	6219
cloak	6219
over	6219
his	6219
shoulders	6220
and	6220
went	6220
out	6220
to	6220
meet	6220
him	6220
menelaus	6220
said	6220
he	6220
let	6220
me	6220
go	6221
back	6221
now	6221
to	6221
my	6221
own	6221
country	6221
for	6221
i	6221
want	6221
to	6221
get	6221
home	6221
and	6223
menelaus	6223
answered	6223
telemachus	6223
if	6223
you	6223
insist	6223
on	6223
going	6223
i	6223
will	6223
not	6224
detain	6224
you	6224
not	6224
like	6224
to	6224
see	6224
a	6224
host	6224
either	6224
too	6224
fond	6224
of	6224
his	6224
guest	6224
or	6225
too	6225
rude	6225
to	6225
him	6225
moderation	6225
is	6225
best	6225
in	6225
all	6225
things	6225
and	6225
not	6225
letting	6225
a	6226
man	6226
go	6226
when	6226
he	6226
wants	6226
to	6226
do	6226
so	6226
is	6226
as	6226
bad	6226
as	6226
telling	6226
him	6226
to	6226
go	6226
if	6226
he	6227
would	6227
like	6227
to	6227
stay	6227
one	6227
should	6227
treat	6227
a	6227
guest	6227
well	6227
as	6227
long	6227
as	6227
he	6227
is	6228
in	6228
the	6228
house	6228
and	6228
speed	6228
him	6228
when	6228
he	6228
wants	6228
to	6228
leave	6228
it	6228
wait	6228
then	6228
till	6229
i	6229
can	6229
get	6229
your	6229
beautiful	6229
presents	6229
into	6229
your	6229

and	6229
till	6229
you	6230
have	6230
yourself	6230
seen	6230
them	6230
i	6230
will	6230
tell	6230
the	6230

to	6230
prepare	6230
a	6230
sufficient	6230
dinner	6231
for	6231
you	6231
of	6231
what	6231
there	6231
may	6231
be	6231
in	6231
the	6231
house	6231
it	6231
will	6231
be	6231
at	6231
once	6231
more	6232
proper	6232
and	6232
cheaper	6232
for	6232
you	6232
to	6232
get	6232
your	6232
dinner	6232
before	6232
setting	6232
out	6233
on	6233
such	6233
a	6233
long	6233
journey	6233
if	6233
moreover	6233
you	6233

a	6233
fancy	6233
for	6233
making	6233
a	6234

in	6234
hellas	6234
or	6234
in	6234
the	6234

you	6235
myself	6235
through	6235
all	6235
our	6235
principal	6235

menelaus	6239
replied	6239
telemachus	6239
i	6239
want	6239
to	6239
go	6239
home	6239
at	6239
once	6239
for	6239
when	6239
i	6240
came	6240
away	6240
i	6240
left	6240
my	6240
property	6240
without	6240
protection	6240
and	6240
fear	6240
that	6240
while	6240
looking	6241
for	6241
my	6241
father	6241
i	6241
shall	6241
come	6241
to	6241

myself	6241
or	6241

that	6241
something	6241
valuable	6242
has	6242
been	6242
stolen	6242
during	6242
my	6242
absence	6242
when	6244
menelaus	6244
heard	6244
this	6244
he	6244
immediately	6244
told	6244
his	6244
wife	6244
and	6244
servants	6244
to	6245
prepare	6245
a	6245
sufficient	6245

what	6245
there	6245
might	6245
be	6245
in	6245
the	6245
house	6245
at	6246
this	6246
moment	6246
eteoneus	6246
joined	6246
him	6246
for	6246
he	6246
lived	6246
close	6246
by	6246
and	6246
had	6246
just	6247

he	6248
at	6248

down	6248
into	6248
his	6248
fragrant	6248
store	6249

all	6303
the	6303
men	6303
and	6303
women	6303
were	6303
running	6303
after	6303
it	6303
and	6303
shouting	6303
it	6304
came	6304
quite	6304
close	6304
up	6304
to	6304
them	6304
and	6304
flew	6304
away	6304
on	6304
their	6304
right	6304
hands	6304
in	6305
front	6305
of	6305
the	6305
horses	6305
when	6305
they	6305
saw	6305
it	6305
they	6305
were	6305
glad	6305
and	6305
their	6305
hearts	6306
took	6306
comfort	6306
within	6306
them	6306
whereon	6306
pisistratus	6306
said	6306
tell	6306
me	6306
menelaus	6307
has	6307
heaven	6307
sent	6307
this	6307
omen	6307
for	6307
us	6307
or	6307
for	6307
you	6307
menelaus	6309
was	6309
thinking	6309
what	6309
would	6309
be	6309
the	6309
most	6309
proper	6309
answer	6309
for	6309
him	6309
to	6310
make	6310
but	6310
helen	6310
was	6310
too	6310
quick	6310
for	6310
him	6310
and	6310
said	6310
i	6310
will	6310
read	6310
this	6310
matter	6311
as	6311
heaven	6311
has	6311
put	6311
it	6311
in	6311
my	6311
heart	6311
and	6311
as	6311
i	6311
doubt	6311
not	6311
that	6311
it	6311
will	6312
come	6312
to	6312
pass	6312
the	6312
eagle	6312
came	6312
from	6312
the	6312
mountain	6312
where	6312
it	6312
was	6312
bred	6312
and	6313
has	6313
its	6313
nest	6313
and	6313
in	6313
like	6313
manner	6313
ulysses	6313
after	6313
having	6313
travelled	6313
far	6314
and	6314
suffered	6314
much	6314
will	6314
return	6314
to	6314
take	6314
his	6314
revenge	6314
if	6314
indeed	6314
he	6315
is	6315
not	6315
back	6315
already	6315
and	6315
hatching	6315
mischief	6315
for	6315
the	6315
suitors	6315
may	6317
jove	6317
so	6317
grant	6317
it	6317
replied	6317
telemachus	6317
if	6317
it	6317
should	6317
prove	6317
to	6317
be	6318
so	6318
i	6318
will	6318
make	6318
vows	6318
to	6318
you	6318
as	6318
though	6318
you	6318
were	6318
a	6318
god	6318
even	6318
when	6318
i	6319
am	6319
at	6319
home	6319
as	6321
he	6321
spoke	6321
he	6321
lashed	6321
his	6321
horses	6321
and	6321
they	6321
started	6321
off	6321
at	6321
full	6321
speed	6321
through	6322
the	6322
town	6322
towards	6322
the	6322
open	6322
country	6322
they	6322
swayed	6322
the	6322
yoke	6322
upon	6322
their	6323
necks	6323
and	6323
travelled	6323
the	6323
whole	6323
day	6323
long	6323
till	6323
the	6323
sun	6323
set	6323
and	6323
darkness	6324
was	6324
over	6324
all	6324
the	6324
land	6324
then	6324
they	6324
reached	6324
pherae	6324
where	6324
diocles	6324
lived	6325
who	6325
was	6325
son	6325
of	6325
ortilochus	6325
the	6325
son	6325
of	6325
alpheus	6325
there	6325
they	6325
passed	6325
the	6326
night	6326
and	6326
were	6326
treated	6326
hospitably	6326
when	6326
the	6326
child	6326
of	6326
morning	6326
rosy-fingered	6327
dawn	6327
appeared	6327
they	6327
again	6327
yoked	6327
their	6327
horses	6327
and	6327
their	6327
places	6328
in	6328
the	6328
chariot	6328
they	6328
drove	6328
out	6328
through	6328
the	6328
inner	6328
gateway	6328
and	6328
under	6329
the	6329
echoing	6329
gatehouse	6329
of	6329
the	6329
outer	6329
court	6329
then	6329
pisistratus	6329
lashed	6329
his	6330
horses	6330
on	6330
and	6330
they	6330
flew	6330
forward	6330
nothing	6330
loath	6330
ere	6330
long	6330
they	6330
came	6330
to	6331
pylos	6331
and	6331
then	6331
telemachus	6331
said	6331
pisistratus	6333
i	6333
hope	6333
you	6333
will	6333
promise	6333
to	6333
do	6333
what	6333
i	6333
am	6333
going	6333
to	6333
ask	6333
you	6334
you	6334
know	6334
our	6334
fathers	6334
were	6334
old	6334
friends	6334
before	6334
us	6334
moreover	6334
we	6334
are	6335
both	6335
of	6335
an	6335
age	6335
and	6335
this	6335
journey	6335
has	6335
brought	6335
us	6335
together	6335
still	6335
more	6336
closely	6336
do	6336
not	6336
therefore	6336
take	6336
me	6336
past	6336
my	6336
ship	6336
but	6336
leave	6336
me	6336
there	6337
for	6337
if	6337
i	6337
go	6337
to	6337
your	6337
father's	6337
house	6337
he	6337
will	6337
try	6337
to	6337
keep	6337
me	6337
in	6337
the	6338
warmth	6338
of	6338
his	6338
good	6338
will	6338
towards	6338
me	6338
and	6338
i	6338
must	6338
go	6338
home	6338
at	6338
once	6338
pisistratus	6340
thought	6340
how	6340
he	6340
should	6340
do	6340
as	6340
he	6340
was	6340
asked	6340
and	6340
in	6340
the	6340
end	6340
he	6341
deemed	6341
it	6341
best	6341
to	6341
turn	6341
his	6341
horses	6341
towards	6341
the	6341
ship	6341
and	6341
put	6341
menelaus's	6341
beautiful	6342
presents	6342
of	6342
gold	6342
and	6342
raiment	6342
in	6342
the	6342
stern	6342
of	6342
the	6342
vessel	6342
then	6343
he	6343
said	6343
go	6343
on	6343
board	6343
at	6343
once	6343
and	6343
tell	6343
your	6343
men	6343
to	6343
do	6343
so	6343
also	6343
before	6344
i	6344
can	6344
reach	6344
home	6344
to	6344
tell	6344
my	6344
father	6344
i	6344
know	6344
how	6344
obstinate	6344
he	6344
is	6345
and	6345
am	6345
sure	6345
he	6345
will	6345
not	6345
let	6345
you	6345
go	6345
he	6345
will	6345
come	6345
down	6345
here	6345
to	6345
fetch	6346
you	6346
and	6346
he	6346
will	6346
not	6346
go	6346
back	6346
without	6346
you	6346
but	6346
he	6346
will	6346
be	6346
very	6346
angry	6347
with	6349
this	6349
he	6349
drove	6349
his	6349
goodly	6349
steeds	6349
back	6349
to	6349
the	6349
city	6349
of	6349
the	6349
pylians	6349
and	6350
soon	6350
reached	6350
his	6350
home	6350
but	6350
telemachus	6350
called	6350
the	6350
men	6350
together	6350
and	6351
gave	6351
his	6351
orders	6351
now	6351
my	6351
men	6351
said	6351
he	6351
get	6351
everything	6351
in	6351
order	6351
on	6352
board	6352
the	6352
ship	6352
and	6352
let	6352
us	6352
set	6352
out	6352
home	6352
thus	6354
did	6354
he	6354
speak	6354
and	6354
they	6354
went	6354
on	6354
board	6354
even	6354
as	6354
he	6354
had	6354
said	6354
but	6354
as	6355
telemachus	6355
was	6355
thus	6355
busied	6355
praying	6355
also	6355
and	6355
sacrificing	6355
to	6355
minerva	6355
in	6356
the	6356
ship's	6356
stern	6356
there	6356
came	6356
to	6356
him	6356
a	6356
man	6356
from	6356
a	6356
distant	6356
country	6356
a	6357
seer	6357
who	6357
was	6357
flying	6357
from	6357
argos	6357
because	6357
he	6357
had	6357
killed	6357
a	6357
man	6357
he	6357
was	6358
descended	6358
from	6358
melampus	6358
who	6358
used	6358
to	6358
live	6358
in	6358
pylos	6358
the	6358
land	6358
of	6358
sheep	6359
he	6359
was	6359
rich	6359
and	6359
owned	6359
a	6359
great	6359
house	6359
but	6359
he	6359
was	6359
driven	6359
into	6359
exile	6360
by	6360
the	6360
great	6360
and	6360
powerful	6360
king	6360
neleus	6360
neleus	6360
seized	6360
his	6360
goods	6360
and	6361
held	6361
them	6361
for	6361
a	6361
whole	6361
year	6361
during	6361
which	6361
he	6361
was	6361
a	6361
close	6361
prisoner	6361
in	6362
the	6362
house	6362
of	6362
king	6362
phylacus	6362
and	6362
in	6362
much	6362
distress	6362
of	6362
mind	6362
both	6362
on	6362
account	6363
of	6363
the	6363
daughter	6363
of	6363
neleus	6363
and	6363
because	6363
he	6363
was	6363
haunted	6363
by	6363
a	6363
great	6364
sorrow	6364
that	6364
dread	6364
erinyes	6364
had	6364
laid	6364
upon	6364
him	6364
in	6364
the	6364
end	6364
however	6364
he	6365
escaped	6365
with	6365
his	6365
life	6365
drove	6365
the	6365
cattle	6365
from	6365
phylace	6365
to	6365
pylos	6365
avenged	6366
the	6366
wrong	6366
that	6366
had	6366
been	6366
done	6366
him	6366
and	6366
gave	6366
the	6366
daughter	6366
of	6366
neleus	6367
to	6367
his	6367
brother	6367
then	6367
he	6367
left	6367
the	6367
country	6367
and	6367
went	6367
to	6367
argos	6367
where	6368
it	6368
was	6368
ordained	6368
that	6368
he	6368
should	6368
reign	6368
over	6368
much	6368
people	6368
there	6368
he	6369
married	6369
established	6369
himself	6369
and	6369
had	6369
two	6369
famous	6369
sons	6369

and	6370
oicleus	6370
of	6370
amphiaraus	6370
who	6371
was	6371
dearly	6371
loved	6371
both	6371
by	6371
jove	6371
and	6371
by	6371
apollo	6371
but	6371
he	6371
did	6371
not	6371
live	6371
to	6372
old	6372
age	6372
for	6372
he	6372
was	6372
killed	6372
in	6372
thebes	6372
by	6372
reason	6372
of	6372
a	6372
woman's	6372
gifts	6372
his	6373

amphilochus	6373
mantius	6373
the	6373

carried	6375
off	6375
cleitus	6375
for	6375
his	6375
beauty's	6375
sake	6375
that	6375
he	6375
might	6375
dwell	6375
among	6376
the	6376
immortals	6376
but	6376
apollo	6376
made	6376
polypheides	6376
the	6376
greatest	6376
seer	6376
in	6377
the	6377
whole	6377
world	6377
now	6377
that	6377
amphiaraus	6377
was	6377
dead	6377
he	6377
quarrelled	6377
with	6377
his	6378
father	6378
and	6378
went	6378
to	6378
live	6378
in	6378
hyperesia	6378
where	6378
he	6378
remained	6378
and	6378
prophesied	6378
for	6379
all	6379
men	6379
his	6381
son	6381
theoclymenus	6381
it	6381
was	6381
who	6381
now	6381
came	6381
up	6381
to	6381
telemachus	6381
as	6381
he	6381
was	6382
making	6382
drink-offerings	6382
and	6382
praying	6382
in	6382
his	6382
ship	6382

quite	6389
truly	6389
i	6389

then	6555
when	6555
they	6555

woman	6556
their	6556
messenger	6556
a	6556
very	6556
cunning	6556

to	6556
my	6556

house	6557
bringing	6557
a	6557
necklace	6557

gold	6557
with	6557
amber	6557
beads	6557
strung	6557
among	6557
it	6557
and	6558
while	6558
my	6558
mother	6558
and	6558
the	6558
servants	6558
had	6558
it	6558
in	6558
their	6558
hands	6558
admiring	6558
it	6559
and	6559
bargaining	6559
about	6559
it	6559
he	6559
made	6559
a	6559
sign	6559
quietly	6559
to	6559
the	6559
woman	6559
and	6559
then	6560
went	6560
back	6560
to	6560
the	6560
ship	6560
whereon	6560
she	6560
took	6560
me	6560
by	6560
the	6560
hand	6560
and	6560
led	6560
me	6561
out	6561
of	6561
the	6561
house	6561
in	6561
the	6561
fore	6561
part	6561
of	6561
the	6561
house	6561
she	6561
saw	6561
the	6561
tables	6561
set	6562
with	6562
the	6562
cups	6562
of	6562
guests	6562
who	6562
had	6562
been	6562
feasting	6562
with	6562
my	6562
father	6562
as	6563
being	6563
in	6563
attendance	6563
on	6563
him	6563
these	6563
were	6563
now	6563
all	6563

to	6563
a	6563
meeting	6563
of	6564
the	6564
public	6564
assembly	6564
so	6564
she	6564
snatched	6564
up	6564
three	6564
cups	6564
and	6564
carried	6564
them	6565
off	6565
in	6565
the	6565
bosom	6565
of	6565
her	6565
dress	6565
while	6565
i	6565
followed	6565
her	6565
for	6565
i	6565
knew	6565
no	6566
better	6566
the	6566
sun	6566

and	6566
darkness	6566
was	6566
over	6566
all	6566
the	6566
land	6566
so	6567
we	6567
hurried	6567
on	6567
as	6567
fast	6567
as	6567

he	6667
embraced	6667
him	6667
kissed	6667
him	6667
all	6667
over	6667

the	6675
town	6675
generally	6675
i	6675
suppose	6675
you	6675

it	6675
better	6675
to	6675
keep	6675
an	6675
eye	6675
on	6675
what	6676
the	6676

so	6678
be	6678
it	6678

telemachus	6678
but	6678
i	6678

still	6679
at	6679
her	6679
old	6680

whether	6680
some	6680
one	6680

married	6680
her	6680
so	6680
that	6680
the	6680

cobwebs	6681
she	6683
is	6683

eumaeus	6683
grieving	6683
and	6683
breaking	6683
her	6684
heart	6684

nothing	6684

weep	6684
both	6684
night	6684
and	6684

whereon	6686
he	6686
crossed	6686
the	6686

telemachus	6688
checked	6688
him	6688
sit	6688
down	6688

he	6688
i	6689

back	6692
to	6692
his	6692
own	6692
place	6692
and	6692
eumaeus	6692
strewed	6692
some	6692
green	6692
brushwood	6693
on	6693
the	6693
floor	6693
and	6693
threw	6693
a	6693
sheepskin	6693
on	6693

of	6693
it	6693
for	6693
telemachus	6693
to	6694
sit	6694
upon	6694
then	6694
the	6694
swineherd	6694
brought	6694
them	6694
platters	6694
of	6694
cold	6694
meat	6694
the	6695

bread	6696
as	6696
fast	6696
as	6696

also	6696
in	6697
bowls	6697
of	6697
ivy-wood	6697
and	6697
took	6697
his	6697

then	6697
they	6697
laid	6698
their	6698

friend	6700
where	6700

this	6700

who	6701

come	6701
here	6702
by	6702
land	6702
to	6704

says	6705
he	6705

a	6705
cretan	6705
and	6705
that	6705
he	6705
has	6705
been	6705
a	6705
great	6705
traveller	6706
at	6706
this	6706
moment	6706
he	6706
is	6706
running	6706
away	6706
from	6706
a	6706

refuge	6707
at	6707
my	6707

your	6708
suppliant	6708
i	6710

by	6710
what	6710
you	6710

just	6710
told	6711
me	6711
how	6711

this	6711
stranger	6711
into	6711
my	6711

not	6712
strong	6712
enough	6712
to	6712
hold	6712
my	6712
own	6712
if	6712
any	6712
man	6712
attacks	6712
me	6712
my	6712
mother	6713
cannot	6713
make	6713
up	6713
her	6713

whether	6713
to	6713
stay	6713
where	6713
she	6713
is	6713
and	6713
look	6713
after	6714
the	6714
house	6714
out	6714
of	6714
respect	6714
for	6714
public	6714
opinion	6714
and	6714
the	6714
memory	6714
of	6714
her	6715
husband	6715

for	6715
her	6715
to	6715

man	6716
of	6716
those	6716
who	6716

wooing	6716
her	6716

the	6716
one	6716
who	6716
will	6716
make	6716
her	6716
the	6716
most	6717
advantageous	6717
offer	6717
still	6717
as	6717
the	6717
stranger	6717
has	6717
come	6717
to	6717
your	6717
station	6717
i	6718
will	6718
find	6718
him	6718
a	6718
cloak	6718
and	6718
shirt	6718
of	6718
good	6718
wear	6718
with	6718
a	6718

send	6719
him	6719
wherever	6719
he	6719
wants	6719
to	6719
go	6719
or	6719
if	6719
you	6719
like	6719
you	6719
can	6719
keep	6720
him	6720
here	6720
at	6720
the	6720
station	6720
and	6720
i	6720
will	6720
send	6720
him	6720
clothes	6720
and	6720
food	6720
that	6721
he	6721
may	6721
be	6721
no	6721
burden	6721
on	6721
you	6721
and	6721
on	6721
your	6721
men	6721
but	6721
i	6721
will	6721
not	6721
have	6721
him	6722
go	6722
near	6722
the	6722
suitors	6722
for	6722
they	6722
are	6722
very	6722
insolent	6722
and	6722
are	6722
sure	6722
to	6723
ill-treat	6723
him	6723
in	6723
a	6723
way	6723
that	6723
would	6723
greatly	6723
grieve	6723
me	6723
no	6723
matter	6723
how	6724
valiant	6724
a	6724
man	6724
may	6724
be	6724
he	6724
can	6724
do	6724
nothing	6724
against	6724
numbers	6724
for	6724
they	6724
will	6725
be	6725
too	6725
strong	6725
for	6725
him	6725
then	6727
ulysses	6727
said	6727
sir	6727
it	6727
is	6727
right	6727
that	6727
i	6727
should	6727
say	6727
something	6727
myself	6727
i	6728
am	6728
much	6728
shocked	6728
about	6728
what	6728
you	6728
have	6728
said	6728
about	6728
the	6728
insolent	6728

in	6729
which	6729
the	6729

behaving	6729
in	6729

of	6729
such	6729
a	6729
man	6729
as	6729
you	6729
are	6730
tell	6730
me	6730
do	6730
you	6730
submit	6730
to	6730
such	6730
treatment	6730
tamely	6730
or	6730
has	6730
some	6730
god	6731
set	6731
your	6731

may	6731
you	6731
not	6731
complain	6731
of	6731
your	6731
brothers	6731
for	6732
it	6732
is	6732
to	6732
these	6732

one	6735
came	6735
and	6735
cut	6735
my	6735
head	6735
off	6735

i	6735
would	6735
go	6735
to	6735
the	6735
house	6735

be	6736
the	6736
bane	6736
of	6736
every	6736
one	6736
of	6736
these	6736

nor	6754
yet	6754
bring	6754
matters	6754
to	6754
an	6754

they	6754
are	6754
making	6754
havoc	6754
of	6755
my	6755
estate	6755
and	6755
before	6755

on	6765
his	6765

in	6765

of	6765
his	6765
bitter	6765
sorrow	6765
about	6765
ulysses	6765

telemachus	6771
i	6771
am	6771
sorry	6771
for	6771
him	6771
but	6771
we	6771

secretly	6776
with	6776
the	6776

let	6776
him	6776
hear	6777
it	6777

did	6779
he	6779
urge	6779
the	6779
swineherd	6779
eumaeus	6779
therefore	6779
took	6779
his	6779

bound	6780
them	6780
to	6780
his	6780
feet	6780

started	6780
for	6780
the	6780
town	6780

watched	6780
him	6781
well	6781
off	6781
the	6781
station	6781
and	6781
then	6781
came	6781
up	6781
to	6781
it	6781
in	6781
the	6781
form	6781
of	6781
a	6781
woman	6782
fair	6782
stately	6782
and	6782
wise	6782
she	6782
stood	6782
against	6782
the	6782
side	6782
of	6782
the	6782
entry	6783
and	6783
revealed	6783
herself	6783
to	6783
ulysses	6783
but	6783
telemachus	6783
could	6783
not	6783
see	6783
her	6784
and	6784
knew	6784
not	6784
that	6784
she	6784
was	6784
there	6784
for	6784
the	6784
gods	6784
do	6784

themselves	6784
be	6785
seen	6785
by	6785
everybody	6785
ulysses	6785
saw	6785
her	6785
and	6785
so	6785
did	6785
the	6785
dogs	6785
for	6785
they	6785
did	6786
not	6786
bark	6786
but	6786
went	6786
scared	6786
and	6786
whining	6786
off	6786
to	6786
the	6786
other	6786
side	6786
of	6786
the	6787
yards	6787
she	6787
nodded	6787
her	6787
head	6787
and	6787
motioned	6787
to	6787
ulysses	6787
with	6787
her	6787
eyebrows	6787
whereon	6788
he	6788
left	6788
the	6788
hut	6788
and	6788
stood	6788
before	6788
her	6788
outside	6788
the	6788
main	6788
wall	6788
of	6789
the	6789
yards	6789
then	6789
she	6789
said	6789

him	6789

not	6792
keep	6792
him	6792
in	6792
the	6792
dark	6792
any	6792
longer	6792
but	6792
lay	6792
your	6792
plans	6792
for	6792
the	6793
destruction	6793
of	6793
the	6793
suitors	6793
and	6793
then	6793
make	6793
for	6793
the	6793
town	6793
i	6793
will	6793
not	6794
be	6794
long	6794
in	6794
joining	6794
you	6794
for	6794
i	6794
too	6794
am	6794
eager	6794
for	6794
the	6794
fray	6794
as	6796
she	6796
spoke	6796
she	6796
touched	6796
him	6796
with	6796
her	6796
golden	6796
wand	6796
first	6796
she	6796
threw	6796
a	6797
fair	6797
clean	6797
shirt	6797
and	6797
cloak	6797
about	6797
his	6797
shoulders	6797
then	6797
she	6797
made	6797
him	6797
younger	6798
and	6798
of	6798
more	6798
imposing	6798
presence	6798
she	6798
gave	6798
him	6798
back	6798
his	6798
colour	6798
filled	6799
out	6799
his	6799
cheeks	6799
and	6799
let	6799
his	6799
beard	6799
become	6799
dark	6799
again	6799
then	6799
she	6799
went	6800
away	6800
and	6800
ulysses	6800
came	6800
back	6800
inside	6800
the	6800
hut	6800
his	6800
son	6800
was	6800
astounded	6800
when	6801
he	6801
saw	6801
him	6801
and	6801
turned	6801
his	6801
eyes	6801
away	6801
for	6801
fear	6801
he	6801
might	6801
be	6801
looking	6801
upon	6802
a	6802
god	6802
stranger	6804
said	6804
he	6804
how	6804
suddenly	6804
you	6804
have	6804
changed	6804
from	6804
what	6804
you	6804
were	6805
a	6805
moment	6805
or	6805
two	6805
ago	6805
you	6805
are	6805
dressed	6805
differently	6805
and	6805
your	6805
colour	6805
is	6806
not	6806
the	6806
same	6806
are	6806
you	6806
some	6806
one	6806
or	6806
other	6806
of	6806
the	6806
gods	6806
that	6806
live	6806
in	6806
heaven	6807
if	6807
so	6807
be	6807
propitious	6807
to	6807
me	6807
till	6807
i	6807
can	6807
make	6807
you	6807
due	6807
sacrifice	6807
and	6808
offerings	6808
of	6808
wrought	6808
gold	6808
have	6808
mercy	6808
upon	6808
me	6808
and	6810
ulysses	6810
said	6810
i	6810
am	6810
no	6810
god	6810
why	6810
should	6810
you	6810
take	6810
me	6810
for	6810
one	6810
i	6810
am	6811
your	6811
father	6811
on	6811
whose	6811
account	6811
you	6811
grieve	6811
and	6811
suffer	6811
so	6811
much	6811
at	6811
the	6812
hands	6812
of	6812
lawless	6812
men	6812
as	6814
he	6814
spoke	6814
he	6814
kissed	6814
his	6814
son	6814
and	6814
a	6814
tear	6814
fell	6814
from	6814
his	6814
cheek	6814
on	6814
to	6814
the	6815
ground	6815
for	6815
he	6815
had	6815
restrained	6815
all	6815
tears	6815
till	6815
now	6815
but	6815
telemachus	6815
could	6816
not	6816
yet	6816
believe	6816
that	6816
it	6816
was	6816
his	6816
father	6816
and	6816
said	6816
you	6818
are	6818
not	6818
my	6818
father	6818
but	6818
some	6818
god	6818
is	6818
flattering	6818
me	6818
with	6818
vain	6818
hopes	6818
that	6819
i	6819
may	6819
grieve	6819
the	6819
more	6819
hereafter	6819
no	6819
mortal	6819
man	6819
could	6819
of	6819
himself	6819
contrive	6820
to	6820
do	6820
as	6820
you	6820
have	6820
been	6820
doing	6820
and	6820
make	6820
yourself	6820
old	6820
and	6820
young	6820
at	6821
a	6821
moment's	6821
notice	6821
unless	6821
a	6821
god	6821
were	6821
with	6821
him	6821
a	6821
second	6821
ago	6821
you	6821
were	6822
old	6822
and	6822
all	6822
in	6822
rags	6822
and	6822
now	6822
you	6822
are	6822
like	6822
some	6822
god	6822
come	6822
down	6822
from	6823
heaven	6823
ulysses	6825
answered	6825
telemachus	6825
you	6825
ought	6825
not	6825
to	6825
be	6825
so	6825
immeasurably	6825
astonished	6826
at	6826
my	6826
being	6826
really	6826
here	6826
there	6826
is	6826
no	6826
other	6826
ulysses	6826
who	6826
will	6827
come	6827
hereafter	6827
such	6827
as	6827
i	6827
am	6827
it	6827
is	6827
i	6827
who	6827
after	6827
long	6827
wandering	6827
and	6828
much	6828
hardship	6828
have	6828
got	6828
home	6828
in	6828
the	6828
twentieth	6828
year	6828
to	6828
my	6828
own	6828
country	6828
what	6829
you	6829
wonder	6829
at	6829
is	6829
the	6829
work	6829
of	6829
the	6829
redoubtable	6829
goddess	6829
minerva	6829
who	6830
does	6830
with	6830
me	6830
whatever	6830
she	6830
will	6830
for	6830
she	6830
can	6830
do	6830
what	6830
she	6830
pleases	6830
at	6831
one	6831
moment	6831
she	6831
makes	6831
me	6831
like	6831
a	6831
beggar	6831
and	6831
the	6831
next	6831
i	6831
am	6831
a	6831
young	6831
man	6832
with	6832
good	6832
clothes	6832
on	6832
my	6832
back	6832
it	6832
is	6832
an	6832
easy	6832
matter	6832
for	6832
the	6832
gods	6832
who	6833
live	6833
in	6833
heaven	6833
to	6833
make	6833
any	6833
man	6833
look	6833
either	6833
rich	6833
or	6833
poor	6833
as	6835
he	6835
spoke	6835
he	6835
sat	6835
down	6835
and	6835
telemachus	6835
threw	6835
his	6835
arms	6835
about	6835
his	6835
father	6835
and	6836
wept	6836
they	6836
were	6836
both	6836
so	6836
much	6836
moved	6836
that	6836
they	6836
cried	6836
aloud	6836
like	6836
eagles	6837
or	6837
vultures	6837
with	6837
crooked	6837
talons	6837
that	6837
have	6837
been	6837
robbed	6837
of	6837
their	6837
half	6838
fledged	6838
young	6838
by	6838
peasants	6838
thus	6838
piteously	6838
did	6838
they	6838
weep	6838
and	6838
the	6839
sun	6839
would	6839
have	6839
gone	6839
down	6839
upon	6839
their	6839
mourning	6839
if	6839
telemachus	6839
had	6839
not	6840
suddenly	6840
said	6840
in	6840
what	6840
ship	6840
my	6840
dear	6840
father	6840
did	6840
your	6840
crew	6840
bring	6840
you	6841
to	6841
ithaca	6841
of	6841
what	6841
nation	6841
did	6841
they	6841
declare	6841
themselves	6841
to	6841
be	6841
for	6841
you	6842
cannot	6842
have	6842
come	6842
by	6842
land	6842
i	6844
will	6844
tell	6844
you	6844
the	6844
truth	6844
my	6844
son	6844
replied	6844
ulysses	6844
it	6844
was	6844
the	6844
phaeacians	6845
who	6845
brought	6845
me	6845
here	6845
they	6845
are	6845
great	6845
sailors	6845
and	6845
are	6845
in	6845
the	6846
habit	6846
of	6846

so	6934
they	6934
went	6935
outside	6935
the	6935
great	6935
wall	6935
that	6935
ran	6935
round	6935
the	6935
outer	6935
court	6935
and	6935
held	6935
a	6936
council	6936
near	6936
the	6936
main	6936
entrance	6936
eurymachus	6936
son	6936
of	6936
polybus	6936
was	6936
the	6937
first	6937
to	6937
speak	6937
my	6939
friends	6939
said	6939
he	6939
this	6939
voyage	6939
of	6939
telemachus's	6939
is	6939
a	6939
very	6939
serious	6939
matter	6940
we	6940
had	6940
made	6940
sure	6940
that	6940
it	6940
would	6940
come	6940
to	6940
nothing	6940
now	6940
however	6940
let	6941
us	6941
draw	6941
a	6941
ship	6941
into	6941
the	6941
water	6941
and	6941
get	6941
a	6941
crew	6941
together	6941
to	6941
send	6941
after	6942
the	6942
others	6942
and	6942
tell	6942
them	6942
to	6942
come	6942
back	6942
as	6942
fast	6942
as	6942
they	6942
can	6942
he	6944
had	6944
hardly	6944
done	6944
speaking	6944
when	6944
amphinomus	6944
turned	6944
in	6944
his	6944
place	6944
and	6944
saw	6945
the	6945
ship	6945
inside	6945
the	6945
harbour	6945
with	6945
the	6945
crew	6945
lowering	6945
her	6945
sails	6945
and	6946
putting	6946
by	6946
their	6946
oars	6946
so	6946
he	6946
laughed	6946
and	6946
said	6946
to	6946
the	6946
others	6946
we	6947
need	6947
not	6947
send	6947
them	6947
any	6947
message	6947
for	6947
they	6947
are	6947
here	6947
some	6947
god	6947
must	6947
have	6948
told	6948
them	6948
or	6948
else	6948
they	6948
saw	6948
the	6948
ship	6948
go	6948
by	6948
and	6948
could	6948
not	6948
overtake	6948
her	6949
on	6951
this	6951
they	6951
rose	6951
and	6951
went	6951
to	6951
the	6951
water	6951
side	6951
the	6951
crew	6951
then	6951
drew	6951
the	6951
ship	6952
on	6952
shore	6952
their	6952
servants	6952
took	6952
their	6952
armour	6952
from	6952
them	6952
and	6952
they	6952
went	6953
up	6953
in	6953
a	6953
body	6953
to	6953
the	6953
place	6953
of	6953
assembly	6953
but	6953
they	6953
would	6953
not	6953
let	6953
any	6954
one	6954
old	6954
or	6954
young	6954
sit	6954
along	6954
with	6954
them	6954
and	6954
antinous	6954
son	6954
of	6954
eupeithes	6954
spoke	6955
first	6955
good	6957
heavens	6957
said	6957
he	6957
see	6957
how	6957
the	6957
gods	6957
have	6957
saved	6957
this	6957
man	6957
from	6957
destruction	6958
we	6958
kept	6958
a	6958
succession	6958
of	6958
scouts	6958
upon	6958
the	6958
headlands	6958
all	6958
day	6959
long	6959
and	6959
when	6959
the	6959
sun	6959
was	6959
down	6959
we	6959
never	6959
went	6959
on	6959
shore	6959
to	6959
sleep	6959
but	6960
waited	6960
in	6960
the	6960
ship	6960
all	6960
night	6960
till	6960
morning	6960
in	6960
the	6960
hope	6960
of	6960
capturing	6960
and	6961
killing	6961
him	6961
but	6961
some	6961
god	6961
has	6961
conveyed	6961
him	6961
home	6961
in	6961
spite	6961
of	6961
us	6961
let	6962
us	6962
consider	6962
how	6962
we	6962
can	6962
make	6962
an	6962
end	6962
of	6962
him	6962
he	6962
must	6962
not	6962
escape	6962
us	6963
our	6963
affair	6963
is	6963
never	6963
likely	6963
to	6963
come	6963
off	6963
while	6963
is	6963
alive	6963
for	6963
he	6963
is	6964
very	6964
shrewd	6964
and	6964
public	6964
feeling	6964
is	6964
by	6964
no	6964
means	6964
all	6964
on	6964
our	6964
side	6964
we	6965
must	6965
make	6965
haste	6965
before	6965
he	6965
can	6965
call	6965
the	6965
achaeans	6965
in	6965
assembly	6965
he	6965
will	6966
lose	6966
no	6966
time	6966
in	6966
doing	6966
so	6966
for	6966
he	6966
will	6966
be	6966
furious	6966
with	6966
us	6966
and	6966
will	6967
tell	6967
all	6967
the	6967
world	6967
how	6967
we	6967
plotted	6967
to	6967
kill	6967
him	6967
but	6967
failed	6967
to	6967
take	6968
him	6968
the	6968
people	6968
will	6968
not	6968
like	6968
this	6968
when	6968
they	6968
come	6968
to	6968
know	6968
of	6968
it	6969
we	6969
must	6969
see	6969
that	6969
they	6969
do	6969
us	6969
no	6969
hurt	6969
nor	6969
drive	6969
us	6969
from	6969
our	6969
own	6969
country	6970
into	6970
exile	6970
let	6970
us	6970
try	6970
and	6970
lay	6970
hold	6970
of	6970
him	6970
either	6970
on	6970
his	6970
farm	6970
away	6971
from	6971
the	6971
town	6971
or	6971
on	6971
the	6971
road	6971
hither	6971
then	6971
we	6971
can	6971
divide	6971
up	6971
his	6971
property	6972
amongst	6972
us	6972
and	6972
let	6972
his	6972
mother	6972
and	6972
the	6972
man	6972
who	6972
marries	6972
her	6972
have	6973
the	6973
house	6973
if	6973
this	6973
does	6973
not	6973
please	6973
you	6973
and	6973
you	6973
wish	6973
telemachus	6973
to	6974
live	6974
on	6974
and	6974
hold	6974
his	6974
father's	6974
property	6974
then	6974
we	6974
must	6974
not	6974
gather	6974
here	6975
and	6975
eat	6975
up	6975
his	6975
goods	6975
in	6975
this	6975
way	6975
but	6975
must	6975
make	6975
our	6975
offers	6975
to	6975
penelope	6976
each	6976
from	6976
his	6976
own	6976
house	6976
and	6976
she	6976
can	6976
marry	6976
the	6976
man	6976
who	6976
will	6976
give	6977
the	6977
most	6977
for	6977
her	6977
and	6977
whose	6977
lot	6977
it	6977
is	6977
to	6977
win	6977
her	6977
they	6979
all	6979
held	6979
their	6979
peace	6979
until	6979
amphinomus	6979
rose	6979
to	6979
speak	6979
he	6979
was	6979
the	6979
son	6980
of	6980
nisus	6980
who	6980
was	6980
son	6980
to	6980
king	6980
aretias	6980
and	6980
he	6980
was	6980
foremost	6980
among	6980
all	6981
the	6981
suitors	6981
from	6981
the	6981
wheat-growing	6981
and	6981
well	6981
grassed	6981
island	6981
of	6981
dulichium	6982
his	6982
conversation	6982
moreover	6982
was	6982
more	6982
agreeable	6982
to	6982
penelope	6982
than	6983
that	6983
of	6983
any	6983
of	6983
the	6983
other	6983
for	6983
he	6983
was	6983
a	6983
man	6983
of	6983
good	6983
natural	6983
disposition	6983
my	6984
friends	6984
said	6984
he	6984
speaking	6984
to	6984
them	6984
plainly	6984
and	6984
in	6984
all	6984
honestly	6984
i	6985
am	6985
not	6985
in	6985
favour	6985
of	6985
killing	6985
telemachus	6985
it	6985
is	6985
a	6985
heinous	6985
thing	6985
to	6985
kill	6986
one	6986
who	6986
is	6986
of	6986
noble	6986
blood	6986
let	6986
us	6986
first	6986
take	6986
counsel	6986
of	6986
the	6986
gods	6986
and	6987
if	6987
the	6987
oracles	6987
of	6987
jove	6987
advise	6987
it	6987
i	6987
will	6987
both	6987
help	6987
to	6987
kill	6987
him	6987
myself	6988
and	6988
will	6988
urge	6988
everyone	6988
else	6988
to	6988
do	6988
so	6988
but	6988
if	6988
they	6988
dissuade	6988
us	6989
i	6989
would	6989
have	6989
you	6989
hold	6989
your	6989
hands	6989
thus	6991
did	6991
he	6991
speak	6991
and	6991
his	6991
words	6991
pleased	6991
them	6991
well	6991
so	6991
they	6991
rose	6991
forthwith	6991
and	6992
went	6992
to	6992
the	6992
house	6992
of	6992
ulysses	6992
where	6992
they	6992
took	6992
their	6992
accustomed	6992
seats	6993
then	6995
penelope	6995
resolved	6995
that	6995
she	6995
would	6995
show	6995
herself	6995
to	6995
the	6995
suitors	6995
she	6996
knew	6996
of	6996
the	6996
plot	6996
against	6996
telemachus	6996
for	6996
the	6996
servant	6996
medon	6996
had	6996
overheard	6997
their	6997
counsels	6997
and	6997
had	6997
told	6997
her	6997
she	6997
went	6997
down	6997
therefore	6997
to	6998
the	6998
court	6998
attended	6998
by	6998
her	6998
maidens	6998
and	6998
when	6998
she	6998
reached	6998
the	6998
suitors	6998
she	6999
stood	6999
by	6999
one	6999
of	6999
the	6999
bearing-posts	6999
supporting	6999
the	6999
roof	6999
of	6999
the	6999
cloister	6999
holding	7000
a	7000
veil	7000
before	7000
her	7000
face	7000
and	7000
rebuked	7000
antinous	7000
saying	7000
antinous	7002
insolent	7002
and	7002
wicked	7002
schemer	7002
they	7002
say	7002
you	7002
are	7002
the	7002
best	7002
speaker	7003
and	7003
counsellor	7003
of	7003
any	7003
man	7003
your	7003
own	7003
age	7003
in	7003
ithaca	7003
but	7003
you	7003
are	7004
nothing	7004
of	7004
the	7004
kind	7004
madman	7004
why	7004
should	7004
you	7004
try	7004
to	7004
compass	7004
the	7004
death	7005
of	7005
telemachus	7005
and	7005
take	7005
no	7005
heed	7005
of	7005
suppliants	7005
whose	7005
witness	7005
is	7006
jove	7006
himself	7006
it	7006
is	7006
not	7006
right	7006
for	7006
you	7006
to	7006
plot	7006
thus	7006
against	7006
one	7006
another	7007
do	7007
you	7007
not	7007
remember	7007
how	7007
your	7007
father	7007
fled	7007
to	7007
this	7007
house	7007
in	7007
fear	7008
of	7008
the	7008
people	7008
who	7008
were	7008
enraged	7008
against	7008
him	7008
for	7008
having	7008
gone	7008
with	7008
some	7009
taphian	7009
pirates	7009
and	7009
plundered	7009
the	7009
thesprotians	7009
who	7009
were	7009
at	7009
peace	7009
with	7010
us	7010
they	7010
wanted	7010
to	7010
tear	7010
him	7010
in	7010
pieces	7010
and	7010
eat	7010
up	7010
everything	7010
he	7010
had	7011
but	7011
ulysses	7011
stayed	7011
their	7011
hands	7011
although	7011
they	7011
were	7011
infuriated	7011
and	7012
now	7012
you	7012
devour	7012
his	7012
property	7012
without	7012
paying	7012
for	7012
it	7012
and	7012
break	7012
my	7012
heart	7013
by	7013
his	7013
wooing	7013
his	7013
wife	7013
and	7013
trying	7013
to	7013
kill	7013
his	7013
son	7013
leave	7013
off	7013
doing	7014
so	7014
and	7014
stop	7014
the	7014
others	7014
also	7014
to	7016
this	7016
eurymachus	7016
son	7016
of	7016
polybus	7016
answered	7016
take	7016
heart	7016
queen	7016
penelope	7016
daughter	7017
of	7017
icarius	7017
and	7017
do	7017
not	7017
trouble	7017
yourself	7017
about	7017
these	7017
matters	7017
the	7018
man	7018
is	7018
not	7018
yet	7018
born	7018
nor	7018
never	7018
will	7018
be	7018
who	7018
shall	7018
lay	7018
hands	7018
upon	7018
your	7019
son	7019
telemachus	7019
while	7019
i	7019
yet	7019
live	7019
to	7019
look	7019
upon	7019
the	7019
face	7019
of	7019
the	7019
earth	7020
i	7020
say	7020
and	7020
it	7020
shall	7020
surely	7020
be	7020
that	7020
my	7020
spear	7020
shall	7020
be	7020
reddened	7020
with	7021
his	7021
blood	7021
for	7021
many	7021
a	7021
time	7021
has	7021
ulysses	7021
taken	7021
me	7021
on	7021
his	7021
knees	7021
held	7022
wine	7022
up	7022
to	7022
my	7022
lips	7022
to	7022
drink	7022
and	7022
put	7022
pieces	7022
of	7022
meat	7022
into	7022
my	7022
hands	7022
therefore	7023
telemachus	7023
is	7023
much	7023
the	7023
dearest	7023
friend	7023
i	7023
have	7023
and	7023
has	7023
nothing	7023
to	7024
fear	7024
from	7024
the	7024
hands	7024
of	7024
us	7024

course	7024
if	7024
death	7024
comes	7024
to	7024
him	7025
from	7025
the	7025
gods	7025
he	7025
cannot	7025
escape	7025
it	7025
he	7025
said	7025
this	7025
to	7025
quiet	7025
her	7025
but	7026
in	7026
reality	7026
he	7026
was	7026
plotting	7026
against	7026
telemachus	7026
then	7028
penelope	7028
went	7028
upstairs	7028
again	7028
and	7028
mourned	7028
her	7028
husband	7028
till	7028
minerva	7028
shed	7029
sleep	7029
over	7029
her	7029
eyes	7029
in	7029
the	7029
evening	7029
eumaeus	7029
got	7029
back	7029
to	7029
ulysses	7029
and	7030
his	7030
son	7030
who	7030
had	7030
just	7030
sacrificed	7030
a	7030
young	7030
pig	7030
of	7030
a	7030
year	7030
old	7030
and	7030
were	7031
ready	7031
helping	7031
one	7031
another	7031
to	7031
get	7031
supper	7031
ready	7031
minerva	7031
therefore	7031
came	7032
up	7032
to	7032
ulysses	7032
turned	7032
him	7032
into	7032
an	7032
old	7032
man	7032
with	7032
a	7032
stroke	7032
of	7032
her	7032
wand	7033
and	7033
clad	7033
him	7033
in	7033
his	7033
old	7033
clothes	7033
again	7033
for	7033
fear	7033
that	7033
the	7033
swineherd	7033
might	7034
recognize	7034
him	7034
and	7034
not	7034
keep	7034
the	7034
secret	7034
but	7034
go	7034
and	7034
tell	7034
penelope	7034
telemachus	7036
was	7036
the	7036
first	7036
to	7036
speak	7036
so	7036
you	7036
have	7036
got	7036
back	7036
eumaeus	7036
said	7037
he	7037
what	7037
is	7037
the	7037
news	7037
of	7037
the	7037
town	7037
have	7037
the	7037
suitors	7037
returned	7037
or	7038
are	7038
they	7038
still	7038
waiting	7038
over	7038
yonder	7038
to	7038
take	7038
me	7038
on	7038
my	7038
way	7038
home	7038
i	7040
did	7040
not	7040
think	7040
of	7040
asking	7040
about	7040
that	7040
replied	7040
eumaeus	7040
when	7040
i	7040
was	7040
in	7041
the	7041
town	7041
i	7041
thought	7041
i	7041
would	7041
give	7041
my	7041
message	7041
and	7041
come	7041
back	7041
as	7041
soon	7041
as	7042
i	7042
could	7042
i	7042
met	7042
a	7042
man	7042
sent	7042
by	7042
those	7042
who	7042
had	7042
gone	7042
with	7042
you	7042
to	7042
pylos	7042
and	7043
he	7043
was	7043
the	7043
first	7043
to	7043
tell	7043
the	7043
new	7043
your	7043
mother	7043
but	7043
i	7043
can	7043
say	7043
what	7043
i	7044
saw	7044
with	7044
my	7044
own	7044
eyes	7044
i	7044
had	7044
just	7044
got	7044
on	7044
to	7044
the	7044
crest	7044
of	7044
the	7044
hill	7044
of	7045
mercury	7045
above	7045
the	7045
town	7045
when	7045
i	7045
saw	7045
a	7045
ship	7045
coming	7045
into	7045
harbour	7045
with	7045
a	7046
number	7046
of	7046
men	7046
in	7046
her	7046
they	7046
had	7046
many	7046
shields	7046
and	7046
spears	7046
and	7046
i	7046
thought	7046
it	7047
was	7047
the	7047
suitors	7047
but	7047
i	7047
cannot	7047
be	7047
sure	7047
on	7049
hearing	7049
this	7049
telemachus	7049
smiled	7049
to	7049
his	7049
father	7049
but	7049
so	7049
that	7049
eumaeus	7049
could	7050
not	7050
see	7050
him	7050
then	7052
when	7052
they	7052
had	7052
finished	7052
their	7052
work	7052
and	7052
the	7052
meal	7052
was	7052
ready	7052
they	7052
ate	7053
it	7053
and	7053
every	7053
man	7053
had	7053
his	7053
full	7053
share	7053
so	7053
that	7053
all	7053
were	7053
satisfied	7053
as	7054
soon	7054
as	7054
they	7054
had	7054
had	7054
enough	7054
to	7054
eat	7054
and	7054
drink	7054
they	7054
laid	7054
down	7054
to	7054
rest	7055
and	7055
enjoyed	7055

boon	7055
of	7055

when	7061
the	7061
child	7061
of	7061
morning	7061
rosy-fingered	7061
dawn	7061
appeared	7061
telemachus	7061
bound	7062
on	7062
his	7062
sandals	7062
and	7062
took	7062
a	7062
strong	7062
spear	7062
that	7062
suited	7062
his	7062
hands	7062
for	7063
he	7063
wanted	7063
to	7063
go	7063
into	7063
the	7063
city	7063
old	7063
friend	7063

myself	7064
to	7064
my	7064

for	7064
she	7064
will	7064
never	7065
leave	7065
off	7065
grieving	7065
till	7065
she	7065
has	7065
seen	7065
me	7065
as	7065

this	7065
unfortunate	7065
stranger	7066
take	7066
him	7066
to	7066
the	7066

and	7066
let	7066
him	7066

one	7066
who	7066

give	7067
him	7067
a	7067
drink	7067
and	7067
a	7067
piece	7067
of	7067
bread	7067
i	7067
have	7067
trouble	7067
enough	7067
of	7068
my	7068
own	7068
and	7068
cannot	7068
be	7068
burdened	7068
with	7068
other	7068
people	7068
if	7068
this	7068
makes	7068
him	7069
angry	7069
so	7069
much	7069
the	7069
worse	7069
for	7069
him	7069
but	7069
i	7069
like	7069
to	7069
say	7069
what	7069
i	7069

then	7071
ulysses	7071

about	7073
remaining	7073
here	7073
at	7073
the	7073
beck	7073
and	7074
call	7074
of	7074

in	7076

this	7080
telemachus	7080
strode	7080
off	7080
through	7080
the	7080
yards	7080
brooding	7080
his	7080
revenge	7080
upon	7081

looking	7088
like	7089

to	7143
make	7143
it	7144
clear	7144
to	7144
me	7144
before	7144
the	7144

back	7144

replied	7148
her	7148
son	7148
we	7148
went	7148
to	7148
pylos	7148
and	7148
saw	7149
nestor	7149
who	7149
took	7149
me	7149
to	7149
his	7149
house	7149
and	7149
treated	7149
me	7149
as	7149
hospitably	7149
as	7150
though	7150
i	7150
were	7150
a	7150
son	7150
of	7150
his	7150
own	7150
who	7150
had	7150
just	7150
returned	7150
after	7150
a	7150
long	7150
absence	7151
so	7151
also	7151
did	7151
his	7151
sons	7151
but	7151
he	7151
said	7151
he	7151
had	7151
not	7151
heard	7151
a	7151
word	7151
from	7152
any	7152

whether	7152
he	7152
was	7152
alive	7152

dead	7152
he	7153
sent	7153
me	7153
therefore	7153
with	7153
a	7153
chariot	7153
and	7153
horses	7153
to	7153
menelaus	7153
there	7153
i	7154
saw	7154
helen	7154
for	7154
whose	7154
sake	7154
so	7154
many	7154
both	7154
argives	7154
and	7154
trojans	7154
were	7154
in	7155
heaven's	7155
wisdom	7155
doomed	7155
to	7155
suffer	7155
menelaus	7155
asked	7155
me	7155
what	7155
it	7155
was	7155
that	7156
had	7156
brought	7156
me	7156
to	7156
lacedaemon	7156
and	7156
i	7156
told	7156
him	7156
the	7156
whole	7156
truth	7156
whereon	7157
he	7157
said	7157
so	7157
then	7157
these	7157
cowards	7157
would	7157
usurp	7157
a	7157
brave	7157
man's	7157
bed	7158
a	7158
hind	7158

her	7158
new-born	7158
young	7158
in	7158
the	7158
lair	7158
of	7158
a	7158

and	7159
then	7159
go	7159
off	7159
to	7159
feed	7159
in	7159
the	7159
forest	7159
or	7159
in	7159
some	7159
grassy	7159
dell	7159
the	7160
lion	7160
when	7160
he	7160
comes	7160
back	7160
to	7160
his	7160
lair	7160

make	7160
short	7160
work	7160
with	7160
the	7161
pair	7161
of	7161
them	7161
and	7161
so	7161
will	7161

these	7161
suitors	7161
by	7161
father	7161
jove	7162

when	7163
he	7163
wrestled	7163
with	7163
philomeleides	7163
in	7163
lesbos	7163
and	7163
threw	7163
him	7163
so	7163
heavily	7163
that	7164
all	7164
the	7164
greeks	7164
cheered	7164
him	7164
if	7164
he	7164
is	7164
still	7164
such	7164
and	7164
were	7164
to	7164
come	7165
near	7165
these	7165
suitors	7165
they	7165
would	7165
have	7165
a	7165
short	7165
shrift	7165
and	7165
a	7165
sorry	7165

the	7167
sea	7167
told	7167

i	7168
tell	7168
you	7168
in	7168
full	7168
he	7168

he	7168
could	7168
see	7168
ulysses	7168
on	7168
an	7168
island	7168
sorrowing	7169
bitterly	7169
in	7169
the	7169
house	7169
of	7169
the	7169
nymph	7169
calypso	7169
who	7169
was	7169
keeping	7169
him	7170
prisoner	7170
and	7170
he	7170
could	7170
not	7170
reach	7170
his	7170
home	7170
for	7170
he	7170
had	7170
no	7170

nor	7171
sailors	7171
to	7171
take	7171
him	7171
over	7171
the	7171
sea	7171
this	7171
was	7171
what	7171
menelaus	7171
told	7171
me	7172
and	7172
when	7172
i	7172
had	7172
heard	7172
his	7172
story	7172
i	7172
came	7172

a	7173
fair	7173

me	7173
safe	7173
home	7173
again	7173
with	7175
these	7175
words	7175
he	7175
moved	7175
the	7175
heart	7175
of	7175
penelope	7175
then	7175
theoclymenus	7175
said	7176
to	7176
her	7176
madam	7178
wife	7178
of	7178

telemachus	7178

to	7179
me	7179
for	7179
i	7179

a	7184
day	7184
of	7184

for	7184
the	7184
suitors	7184

an	7184
omen	7184

the	7185
ship	7185

about	7185
it	7186
may	7188
it	7188
be	7188
even	7188
so	7188
answered	7188
penelope	7188

thus	7192
did	7192
they	7192
converse	7192
meanwhile	7192
the	7192
suitors	7192
were	7192
throwing	7192

aiming	7193
with	7193

the	7217
road	7217

a	7217
very	7217
rough	7217
one	7217
as	7219
he	7219
spoke	7219
he	7219
threw	7219
his	7219
shabby	7219
old	7219
tattered	7219
wallet	7219
over	7219
his	7219
shoulders	7219
by	7220
the	7220
cord	7220
from	7220
which	7220
it	7220
hung	7220
and	7220
eumaeus	7220
gave	7220
him	7220
a	7220
stick	7220
to	7220
his	7220
liking	7221
the	7221
two	7221
then	7221
started	7221
leaving	7221
the	7221
station	7221
in	7221
charge	7221
of	7221
the	7221
dogs	7222
and	7222
herdsmen	7222
who	7222
remained	7222
behind	7222
the	7222
swineherd	7222
led	7222
the	7222
way	7222
and	7222
his	7223
master	7223
followed	7223
after	7223
looking	7223
like	7223
some	7223
broken-down	7223
old	7223
tramp	7223
as	7224
he	7224
leaned	7224
upon	7224
his	7224
staff	7224
and	7224
his	7224
clothes	7224
were	7224
all	7224
in	7224
rags	7224
when	7224
they	7225
had	7225
got	7225
over	7225
the	7225
rough	7225
steep	7225
ground	7225
and	7225
were	7225
nearing	7225
the	7225
city	7225
they	7226
reached	7226
the	7226
fountain	7226
from	7226
which	7226
the	7226
citizens	7226
drew	7226
their	7226
water	7226
this	7227
had	7227
been	7227
made	7227
by	7227
ithacus	7227
neritus	7227
and	7227
polyctor	7227
there	7227
was	7227
a	7227
grove	7228
of	7228
water-loving	7228
poplars	7228
planted	7228
in	7228
a	7228
circle	7228
all	7228
round	7228
it	7228
and	7228
the	7229
clear	7229
cold	7229
water	7229
came	7229
down	7229
to	7229
it	7229
from	7229
a	7229
rock	7229
high	7229
up	7229
while	7229
above	7229
the	7230
fountain	7230
there	7230
was	7230
an	7230
altar	7230
to	7230
the	7230
nymphs	7230
at	7230
which	7230
all	7230
wayfarers	7230
used	7231
to	7231
sacrifice	7231
here	7231
melanthius	7231
son	7231
of	7231
dolius	7231
overtook	7231
them	7231
as	7231
he	7232
was	7232
driving	7232
down	7232
some	7232
goats	7232
the	7232
best	7232
in	7232
his	7232
flock	7232
for	7232
the	7232
suitors	7232
dinner	7233
and	7233
there	7233
were	7233
two	7233
shepherds	7233
with	7233
him	7233
when	7233
he	7233
saw	7233
eumaeus	7233
and	7234
ulysses	7234
he	7234
reviled	7234
them	7234
with	7234
outrageous	7234
and	7234
unseemly	7234
language	7234
which	7235
made	7235
ulysses	7235
very	7235
angry	7235
there	7237
you	7237
go	7237
cried	7237
he	7237
and	7237
a	7237
precious	7237
pair	7237
you	7237
are	7237
see	7237
how	7237
heaven	7237
brings	7238
birds	7238
of	7238
the	7238
same	7238
feather	7238
to	7238
one	7238
another	7238
where	7238
pray	7238
master	7238
swineherd	7239
are	7239
you	7239
taking	7239
this	7239
poor	7239
miserable	7239
object	7239
it	7239
would	7239
make	7239
any	7240
one	7240
sick	7240
to	7240
see	7240
such	7240
a	7240
creature	7240
at	7240
table	7240
a	7240
fellow	7240
like	7240
this	7240
never	7240
won	7241
a	7241
prize	7241
for	7241
anything	7241
in	7241
his	7241
life	7241
but	7241
will	7241
go	7241
about	7241
rubbing	7241
his	7241
shoulders	7242
against	7242
every	7242
man's	7242
door	7242
post	7242
and	7242
begging	7242
not	7242
for	7242
swords	7242
and	7243
cauldrons	7243
like	7243
a	7243
man	7243
but	7243
only	7243
for	7243
a	7243
few	7243
scraps	7243
not	7243
worth	7243
begging	7243
for	7244
if	7244
you	7244
would	7244
give	7244
him	7244
to	7244
me	7244
for	7244
a	7244
hand	7244
on	7244
my	7244
station	7244
he	7244
might	7244
do	7245
to	7245
clean	7245
out	7245
the	7245
folds	7245
or	7245
bring	7245
a	7245
bit	7245
of	7245
sweet	7245
feed	7245
to	7245
the	7245
kids	7245
and	7246
he	7246
could	7246
fatten	7246
his	7246
thighs	7246
as	7246
much	7246
as	7246
he	7246
pleased	7246
on	7246
whey	7246
but	7246
he	7247
has	7247
taken	7247
to	7247
bad	7247
ways	7247
and	7247
will	7247
not	7247
go	7247
about	7247
any	7247
kind	7247
of	7247
work	7247
he	7247
will	7248
do	7248
nothing	7248
but	7248
beg	7248
victuals	7248
all	7248
the	7248
town	7248
over	7248
to	7248
feed	7248
his	7248
insatiable	7248
belly	7249
i	7249
say	7249
therefore	7249
and	7249
it	7249
shall	7249
surely	7249
be	7249
if	7249
he	7249
goes	7249
near	7249
ulysses	7249
house	7250
he	7250
will	7250
get	7250
his	7250
head	7250
broken	7250
by	7250
the	7250
stools	7250
they	7250
will	7250
fling	7250
at	7250
him	7251
till	7251
they	7251
turn	7251
him	7251
out	7251
on	7253
this	7253
as	7253
he	7253
passed	7253
he	7253
gave	7253
ulysses	7253
a	7253
kick	7253
on	7253
the	7253
hip	7253
out	7253
of	7253
pure	7253
wantonness	7254
but	7254
ulysses	7254
stood	7254
firm	7254
and	7254
did	7254
not	7254
budge	7254
from	7254
the	7254
path	7254
for	7255
a	7255
moment	7255
he	7255
doubted	7255
whether	7255
or	7255
no	7255
to	7255
fly	7255
at	7255
melanthius	7255
and	7255
kill	7255
him	7256
with	7256
his	7256
staff	7256
or	7256
fling	7256
him	7256
to	7256
the	7256
ground	7256
and	7256
beat	7256
his	7256
brains	7256
out	7257
he	7257
resolved	7257
however	7257
to	7257
endure	7257
it	7257
and	7257
keep	7257
himself	7257
in	7257
check	7257
but	7258
the	7258
swineherd	7258
looked	7258
straight	7258
at	7258
melanthius	7258
and	7258
rebuked	7258
him	7258
lifting	7258
up	7259
his	7259
hands	7259
and	7259
praying	7259
to	7259
heaven	7259
as	7259
he	7259
did	7259
so	7259
fountain	7261
nymphs	7261
he	7261
cried	7261
children	7261
of	7261
jove	7261
if	7261
ever	7261
ulysses	7261
burned	7261
you	7262
thigh	7262
bones	7262
covered	7262
with	7262
fat	7262
whether	7262
of	7262
lambs	7262
or	7262
kids	7262
grant	7262
my	7262
prayer	7263
that	7263
heaven	7263
may	7263
send	7263
him	7263
home	7263
he	7263
would	7263
soon	7263
put	7263
an	7263
end	7263
to	7263
the	7264
swaggering	7264
threats	7264
with	7264
which	7264
such	7264
men	7264
as	7264
you	7264
go	7264
about	7264
insulting	7264
people-gadding	7265
all	7265
over	7265
the	7265
town	7265
while	7265
your	7265
flocks	7265
are	7265
going	7265
to	7265
ruin	7265
through	7266
bad	7266
shepherding	7266
then	7268
melanthius	7268
the	7268
goatherd	7268
answered	7268
you	7268
ill-conditioned	7268
cur	7268
what	7268
are	7269
you	7269
talking	7269
about	7269
some	7269
day	7269
or	7269
other	7269
i	7269
will	7269
put	7269
you	7269
on	7269
board	7269
ship	7269
and	7270
take	7270
you	7270
to	7270
a	7270
foreign	7270
country	7270
where	7270
i	7270
can	7270
sell	7270
you	7270
and	7270
pocket	7270
the	7271
money	7271
you	7271
will	7271
fetch	7271
i	7271
wish	7271
i	7271
were	7271
as	7271
sure	7271
that	7271
apollo	7271
would	7271
strike	7272
telemachus	7272
dead	7272
this	7272
very	7272
day	7272
or	7272
that	7272
the	7272
suitors	7272
would	7272
kill	7272
him	7273
as	7273
i	7273
am	7273
that	7273
ulysses	7273
will	7273
never	7273
come	7273
home	7273
again	7273
with	7275
this	7275
he	7275
left	7275
them	7275
to	7275
come	7275
on	7275
at	7275
their	7275
leisure	7275
while	7275
he	7275
went	7275
quickly	7276
forward	7276
and	7276
soon	7276
reached	7276
the	7276
house	7276
of	7276
his	7276
master	7276
when	7276
he	7276
got	7277
there	7277
he	7277
went	7277
in	7277
and	7277
took	7277
his	7277
seat	7277
among	7277
the	7277
suitors	7277
opposite	7277
eurymachus	7278
who	7278
liked	7278
him	7278
better	7278
than	7278
any	7278
of	7278
the	7278
others	7278
the	7278
servants	7278
brought	7279
him	7279
a	7279
portion	7279
of	7279
meat	7279
and	7279
an	7279
upper	7279
woman	7279
servant	7279
set	7279
bread	7279
before	7280
him	7280
that	7280
he	7280
might	7280
eat	7280
presently	7280
ulysses	7280
and	7280
the	7280
swineherd	7280
came	7281
up	7281
to	7281
the	7281
house	7281
and	7281
stood	7281
by	7281
it	7281
amid	7281
a	7281
sound	7281
of	7281
music	7281
for	7281
phemius	7281
was	7282
just	7282
beginning	7282
to	7282
sing	7282
to	7282
the	7282
suitors	7282
then	7282
ulysses	7282
took	7282
hold	7282
of	7283
the	7283
swineherd's	7283
hand	7283
and	7283
said	7283
eumaeus	7285
this	7285
house	7285
of	7285
ulysses	7285
is	7285
a	7285
very	7285
fine	7285
place	7285
no	7285
matter	7285
how	7285
far	7286
you	7286
go	7286
you	7286
will	7286
find	7286
few	7286
like	7286
it	7286
one	7286
building	7286
keeps	7286
following	7286
on	7287
after	7287
another	7287
the	7287
outer	7287
court	7287
has	7287
a	7287
wall	7287
with	7287
battlements	7287
all	7287
round	7288
it	7288
the	7288
doors	7288
are	7288
double	7288
folding	7288
and	7288
of	7288
good	7288
workmanship	7288
it	7288
would	7289
be	7289
a	7289
hard	7289
matter	7289
to	7289
take	7289
it	7289
by	7289
force	7289
of	7289
arms	7289
i	7289
perceive	7289
too	7289
that	7290
there	7290
are	7290
many	7290
people	7290
banqueting	7290
within	7290
it	7290
for	7290
there	7290
is	7290
a	7290
smell	7290
of	7291
roast	7291
meat	7291
and	7291
i	7291
hear	7291
a	7291
sound	7291
of	7291
music	7291
which	7291
the	7291
gods	7291
have	7291
made	7291
to	7292
go	7292
along	7292
with	7292
feasting	7292
then	7294
eumaeus	7294
said	7294
you	7294
have	7294
perceived	7294
aright	7294
as	7294
indeed	7294
you	7294
generally	7294
do	7295
but	7295
let	7295
us	7295
think	7295
what	7295
will	7295
be	7295
our	7295
best	7295
course	7295
will	7295
you	7295
go	7295
inside	7295
first	7296
and	7296
join	7296
the	7296
suitors	7296
leaving	7296
me	7296
here	7296
behind	7296
you	7296
or	7296
will	7296
you	7296
wait	7297
here	7297
and	7297
let	7297
me	7297
go	7297
in	7297
first	7297
but	7297
do	7297
not	7297
wait	7297
long	7297
or	7297
some	7297
one	7297
may	7298
you	7298
loitering	7298
about	7298
outside	7298
and	7298
throw	7298
something	7298
at	7298
you	7298
consider	7298
this	7299
matter	7299
i	7299
pray	7299
you	7299
and	7301
ulysses	7301
answered	7301
i	7301
understand	7301
and	7301
heed	7301
go	7301
in	7301
first	7301
and	7301
leave	7301
me	7302
here	7302
where	7302
i	7302
am	7302
i	7302
am	7302
quite	7302
used	7302
to	7302
being	7302
beaten	7302
and	7302
having	7302
things	7302
thrown	7303
at	7303
me	7303
i	7303
have	7303
been	7303
so	7303

this	7304
too	7304

a	7304

away	7305
the	7305
cravings	7305
of	7305
a	7305
hungry	7305
belly	7305
this	7305
is	7305
an	7305
enemy	7305
which	7306
gives	7306
much	7306
trouble	7306
to	7306
all	7306
men	7306
it	7306
is	7306
because	7306
of	7306
this	7306

fitted	7307
out	7307
to	7307

war	7307
upon	7307
other	7307
people	7307
as	7309
they	7309
were	7309
thus	7309
talking	7309
a	7309
dog	7309
that	7309
had	7309
been	7309
lying	7309
asleep	7309
raised	7309
his	7310
head	7310
and	7310
pricked	7310
up	7310
his	7310
ears	7310
this	7310
was	7310
argos	7310
whom	7310
ulysses	7310
had	7310
bred	7311
before	7311
setting	7311
out	7311
for	7311
troy	7311
but	7311
he	7311
had	7311
never	7311
had	7311
any	7311
work	7311
out	7311
of	7312
him	7312
in	7312
the	7312
old	7312
days	7312
he	7312
used	7312
to	7312
be	7312
taken	7312
out	7312
by	7312
the	7312
young	7312
men	7312
when	7312
they	7313
went	7313
hunting	7313
wild	7313
goats	7313
or	7313
deer	7313
or	7313
hares	7313
but	7313
now	7313
that	7313
his	7313
master	7314
was	7314
gone	7314
he	7314
was	7314
lying	7314
neglected	7314
on	7314
the	7314
heaps	7314
of	7314
mule	7314
and	7314
cow	7314
dung	7315
that	7315
lay	7315
in	7315
front	7315
of	7315
the	7315
stable	7315
doors	7315
till	7315
the	7315
men	7315
should	7315
come	7315
and	7316
draw	7316
it	7316
away	7316
to	7316
manure	7316
the	7316
great	7316
close	7316
and	7316
he	7316
was	7316
full	7316
of	7316
fleas	7316
as	7317
soon	7317
as	7317
he	7317
saw	7317
ulysses	7317
standing	7317
there	7317
he	7317
dropped	7317
his	7317
ears	7317
and	7317
wagged	7318
his	7318
tail	7318
but	7318
he	7318
could	7318
not	7318
get	7318
close	7318
up	7318
to	7318
his	7318
master	7318
when	7318
ulysses	7319
saw	7319
the	7319
dog	7319
on	7319
the	7319
other	7319
side	7319
of	7319
the	7319
yard	7319
dashed	7319
a	7319
tear	7319
from	7319
his	7320
eyes	7320
without	7320
eumaeus	7320
seeing	7320
it	7320
and	7320
said	7320
eumaeus	7322
what	7322
a	7322
noble	7322
hound	7322
that	7322
is	7322
over	7322
yonder	7322
on	7322
the	7322
manure	7322
heap	7322
his	7323
build	7323
is	7323
splendid	7323
is	7323
he	7323
as	7323
fine	7323
a	7323
fellow	7323
as	7323
he	7323
looks	7323
or	7323
is	7323
he	7323
only	7324
one	7324
of	7324
those	7324
dogs	7324
that	7324
come	7324
begging	7324
about	7324
a	7324
table	7324
and	7324
are	7324
kept	7324
merely	7325
for	7325
show	7325
this	7327
hound	7327
answered	7327
eumaeus	7327
belonged	7327
to	7327
him	7327
who	7327
has	7327
died	7327
in	7327
a	7327
far	7328
country	7328
if	7328
he	7328
were	7328
what	7328
he	7328
was	7328
when	7328
ulysses	7328
left	7328
for	7328
troy	7328
he	7328
would	7329
soon	7329
show	7329
you	7329
what	7329
he	7329
could	7329
do	7329
there	7329
was	7329
not	7329
a	7329
wild	7329
beast	7329
in	7329
the	7330
forest	7330
that	7330
could	7330
get	7330
away	7330
from	7330
him	7330
when	7330
he	7330
was	7330
once	7330
on	7330
its	7330
tracks	7330
but	7331
now	7331
he	7331
has	7331
fallen	7331
on	7331
evil	7331
times	7331
for	7331
his	7331
master	7331
is	7331
dead	7331
and	7331
gone	7331
and	7332
the	7332
women	7332
take	7332
no	7332

of	7332
him	7332
servants	7332
never	7332

their	7332

when	7332
their	7333
master's	7333
hand	7333
is	7333
no	7333
longer	7333
over	7333
them	7333
for	7333
jove	7333
takes	7333
half	7333
the	7333
goodness	7334
out	7334
of	7334
a	7334
man	7334
when	7334
he	7334
makes	7334
a	7334
slave	7334
of	7334
him	7334
as	7336
he	7336
spoke	7336
he	7336
went	7336
inside	7336
the	7336
buildings	7336
to	7336
the	7336
cloister	7336
where	7336
the	7336
suitors	7337
were	7337
but	7337
argos	7337
died	7337
as	7337
soon	7337
as	7337
he	7337
had	7337
recognized	7337
his	7337
master	7337
telemachus	7339
saw	7339
eumaeus	7339
long	7339
before	7339
any	7339
one	7339
else	7339
did	7339
and	7339
beckoned	7339
him	7340
to	7340
come	7340
and	7340
sit	7340
beside	7340
him	7340
so	7340
he	7340
looked	7340
about	7340
and	7340
saw	7340
a	7340
seat	7340
lying	7341
near	7341
where	7341
the	7341
carver	7341
sat	7341
serving	7341
out	7341
their	7341
portions	7341
to	7341
the	7341
suitors	7342
he	7342
picked	7342
it	7342
up	7342
brought	7342
it	7342
to	7342
telemachus's	7342
table	7342
and	7342
sat	7342
down	7343
opposite	7343
him	7343
then	7343
the	7343
servant	7343
brought	7343
him	7343
his	7343
portion	7343
and	7343
gave	7343
him	7344
bread	7344
from	7344
the	7344
bread-basket	7344
immediately	7346
afterwards	7346
ulysses	7346
came	7346
inside	7346
looking	7346
like	7346
a	7346
poor	7346
miserable	7346
old	7347
beggar	7347
leaning	7347
on	7347
his	7347
staff	7347
and	7347
with	7347
his	7347
clothes	7347
all	7347
in	7347
rags	7347
he	7348
sat	7348
down	7348
upon	7348
the	7348
threshold	7348
of	7348
ash-wood	7348
just	7348
inside	7348
the	7348
doors	7348
leading	7348
from	7349
the	7349
outer	7349
to	7349
the	7349
inner	7349
court	7349
and	7349
against	7349
a	7349
bearing-post	7349
of	7349
cypress-wood	7349
which	7350
the	7350
carpenter	7350
had	7350
skillfully	7350
planed	7350
and	7350
had	7350
made	7350
to	7350
join	7350
truly	7350
with	7351
rule	7351
and	7351
line	7351
telemachus	7351
took	7351
a	7351
whole	7351
loaf	7351
from	7351
the	7351
bread-basket	7351
with	7352
as	7352
much	7352
meat	7352
as	7352
he	7352
could	7352
hold	7352
in	7352
his	7352
two	7352
hands	7352
and	7352
said	7352
to	7352
eumaeus	7352
take	7353
this	7353
to	7353
the	7353
stranger	7353
and	7353
tell	7353
him	7353
to	7353
go	7353
the	7353
round	7353
of	7353
the	7353
suitors	7353
and	7354
beg	7354
from	7354
them	7354
a	7354
beggar	7354
must	7354
not	7354
be	7354
shamefaced	7354
so	7356
eumaeus	7356
went	7356
up	7356
to	7356
him	7356
and	7356
said	7356
stranger	7356
telemachus	7356
sends	7356
you	7356
this	7357
and	7357
says	7357
you	7357
are	7357
to	7357
go	7357
the	7357
round	7357
of	7357
the	7357
suitors	7357
begging	7357
for	7357
beggars	7358
must	7358
not	7358
be	7358
shamefaced	7358
ulysses	7360
answered	7360
may	7360
king	7360
jove	7360
grant	7360
all	7360
happiness	7360
to	7360
telemachus	7360
and	7361
fulfil	7361
the	7361
desire	7361
of	7361
his	7361
heart	7361
then	7363
with	7363
both	7363
hands	7363
he	7363
took	7363
what	7363
telemachus	7363
had	7363
sent	7363
him	7363
and	7363
laid	7363
it	7364
on	7364
the	7364
dirty	7364
old	7364
wallet	7364
at	7364
his	7364
feet	7364
he	7364
went	7364
on	7364
eating	7364
it	7364
while	7364
the	7365
bard	7365
was	7365
singing	7365
and	7365
had	7365
just	7365
finished	7365
his	7365
dinner	7365
as	7365
he	7365
left	7365
off	7366
the	7366
suitors	7366
applauded	7366
the	7366
bard	7366
whereon	7366
minerva	7366
went	7366
up	7366
to	7366
ulysses	7366
and	7367
prompted	7367
him	7367
to	7367
beg	7367
pieces	7367
of	7367
bread	7367
from	7367
each	7367
one	7367
of	7367
the	7367
suitors	7367
that	7368
he	7368
might	7368
see	7368
what	7368
kind	7368
of	7368
people	7368
they	7368
were	7368
and	7368
tell	7368
the	7368
good	7368
from	7369
the	7369
bad	7369
but	7369
come	7369
what	7369
might	7369
she	7369
was	7369
not	7369
going	7369
to	7369
save	7369
a	7369
single	7369
one	7370
of	7370
them	7370
ulysses	7370
therefore	7370
went	7370
on	7370
his	7370
round	7370
going	7370
from	7370
left	7370
to	7371
right	7371
and	7371
stretched	7371
out	7371
his	7371
hands	7371
to	7371
beg	7371
as	7371
though	7371
he	7371
were	7371
a	7371
real	7371
beggar	7372
some	7372
of	7372
them	7372
pitied	7372
him	7372
and	7372
were	7372
curious	7372
about	7372
him	7372
asking	7372
one	7373
another	7373
who	7373
he	7373
was	7373
and	7373
where	7373
he	7373
came	7373
from	7373
whereon	7373
the	7373
goatherd	7373
melanthius	7374

my	7374

him	7375
before	7375
the	7375

himself	7376
nor	7376

he	7376
comes	7376
from	7376
on	7378
this	7378

to	7378
abuse	7378
the	7378
swineherd	7378
you	7378
precious	7378
idiot	7378
he	7379
cried	7379

us	7380
as	7380
we	7380

you	7381
think	7381
it	7381
a	7381
small	7381
thing	7381
that	7381
such	7381
people	7381
gather	7381
here	7381
to	7381

bring	7382
this	7382
man	7382
as	7382
well	7382

eumaeus	7384
answered	7384
antinous	7384
your	7384
birth	7384
is	7384
good	7384
but	7384
your	7384
words	7384
evil	7385
it	7385
was	7385
no	7385
doing	7385

invite	7386
a	7386

a	7386
foreign	7386

who	7387
can	7387
do	7387
public	7387

a	7387
healer	7387
of	7387

a	7387
carpenter	7387

only	7389

harder	7390

turning	7397
to	7397

of	7398
my	7398

telemachus	7405
replied	7405
antinous	7405
by	7405
this	7405
swaggering	7405
talk	7406
if	7406
all	7406

him	7406
as	7406

another	7407
three	7407
months	7407

he	7409
spoke	7409
he	7409
drew	7409
the	7409
stool	7409
on	7409
which	7409
he	7409
rested	7409
his	7409
dainty	7409
feet	7409
from	7409
under	7410
the	7410
table	7410
and	7410
made	7410
as	7410
though	7410
he	7410
would	7410
throw	7410

the	7411

all	7411
gave	7411
him	7411
something	7411

filled	7411
his	7411
wallet	7411
with	7412
bread	7412

meat	7412
he	7412
was	7412
about	7412
therefore	7412
to	7412
go	7412
back	7412
to	7412
the	7412

eat	7413
what	7413
the	7413

had	7413
given	7413
him	7413
but	7413
he	7413
first	7413
went	7413
up	7413
to	7413
antinous	7413
and	7414
said	7414
sir	7416
give	7416
me	7416
something	7416
you	7416
are	7416
not	7416
surely	7416
the	7416
poorest	7416
man	7416
here	7416
you	7417

be	7417
a	7417
chief	7417
foremost	7417
among	7417
them	7417
all	7417
therefore	7417
you	7417
should	7417
be	7418
the	7418
better	7418
giver	7418
and	7418
i	7418
will	7418
tell	7418
far	7418
and	7418
wide	7418
of	7418
your	7418
bounty	7418
i	7419
too	7419
was	7419
a	7419
rich	7419
man	7419
once	7419

jove	7423
to	7423

a	7423
band	7423
of	7424
roving	7424
robbers	7424
to	7424
egypt	7424

in	7425
the	7425

bade	7425
my	7425

by	7426
them	7426
and	7426
keep	7426
guard	7426
over	7426
them	7426
while	7426

reconnoitre	7427
from	7427
every	7427
point	7427
of	7427

but	7429
the	7429
men	7429
disobeyed	7429
my	7429
orders	7429
took	7429
to	7429
their	7429
own	7429
devices	7429
and	7429
ravaged	7429
the	7430
land	7430
of	7430
the	7430
egyptians	7430
killing	7430
the	7430

the	7431
alarm	7431
was	7431
soon	7431
carried	7431
to	7431
the	7431
city	7431
and	7431
when	7432
they	7432
heard	7432
the	7432
war-cry	7432
the	7432
people	7432
came	7432
out	7432
at	7432
daybreak	7432
till	7432
the	7433

filled	7433
with	7433

foot	7433
and	7433
with	7433
the	7433
gleam	7433
of	7434
armour	7434
then	7434
jove	7434
spread	7434
panic	7434
among	7434
my	7434
men	7434
and	7434
they	7434
would	7434
no	7434
longer	7435
face	7435
the	7435
enemy	7435
for	7435
they	7435
found	7435
themselves	7435
surrounded	7435
the	7435
egyptians	7435
killed	7436
many	7436
of	7436
us	7436

alive	7436
to	7436
do	7436
forced	7436
labour	7436
for	7436
them	7437
as	7437
for	7437
myself	7437
they	7437
gave	7437
me	7437
to	7437
a	7437
friend	7437
who	7437
met	7437
them	7437
to	7437

was	7438
a	7438

man	7438
in	7438
cyprus	7438
thence	7439
i	7439

hither	7439
in	7439
a	7439
state	7439
of	7439
great	7439
misery	7439
then	7441
antinous	7441
said	7441
what	7441
god	7441

have	7441
sent	7441
such	7441
a	7441
pestilence	7441

into	7442
the	7442
open	7442
part	7442
of	7442
the	7442

or	7442
i	7443
will	7443
give	7443
you	7443
egypt	7443
and	7443
cyprus	7443
over	7443
again	7443
for	7443
your	7443
insolence	7443
and	7443
importunity	7444
you	7444
have	7444
begged	7444
of	7444
all	7444
the	7444
others	7444
and	7444
they	7444
have	7444
given	7444
you	7445
lavishly	7445
for	7445
they	7445
have	7445
abundance	7445
round	7445
them	7445
and	7445
it	7445
is	7445
easy	7445
to	7445
be	7446
free	7446
with	7446
other	7446
people's	7446
property	7446
when	7446
there	7446
is	7446
plenty	7446
of	7446
it	7446
on	7448
this	7448
ulysses	7448
began	7448
to	7448
move	7448
off	7448
and	7448
said	7448
your	7448
looks	7448
my	7448
fine	7448
sir	7449
are	7449
better	7449
than	7449
your	7449
breeding	7449
if	7449
you	7449
were	7449
in	7449
your	7449
own	7449
house	7449
you	7450
would	7450
not	7450
spare	7450
a	7450
poor	7450
man	7450
so	7450
much	7450
as	7450
a	7450
pinch	7450
of	7450
salt	7450
for	7450
though	7450
you	7451
are	7451
in	7451
another	7451
man's	7451
and	7451
surrounded	7451
with	7451
abundance	7451
you	7451
cannot	7451
find	7452
it	7452
in	7452
you	7452
to	7452
give	7452
him	7452
even	7452
a	7452
piece	7452
of	7452
bread	7452
this	7454
made	7454
antinous	7454
very	7454
angry	7454
and	7454
he	7454
scowled	7454
at	7454
him	7454
saying	7454
you	7454
shall	7455
pay	7455
for	7455
this	7455
before	7455
you	7455
get	7455
clear	7455
of	7455
the	7455
court	7455
with	7455
these	7455
words	7456
he	7456
threw	7456
a	7456
footstool	7456
at	7456
him	7456
and	7456
hit	7456
him	7456
on	7456
the	7456
right	7456
shoulder-blade	7456
near	7457
the	7457
top	7457
of	7457
his	7457
back	7457
ulysses	7457
stood	7457
firm	7457
as	7457
a	7457
rock	7457
and	7457
the	7457
blow	7457
did	7458
not	7458
even	7458
stagger	7458
him	7458
but	7458
he	7458
shook	7458
his	7458
head	7458
in	7458
silence	7458
as	7458
he	7458
brooded	7458
on	7459
his	7459
revenge	7459
then	7459
he	7459
went	7459
back	7459
to	7459
the	7459
threshold	7459
and	7459
sat	7459
down	7459
there	7459
laying	7460
his	7460
well-filled	7460
wallet	7460
at	7460
his	7460
feet	7460
listen	7462
to	7462
me	7462
he	7462
cried	7462
you	7462
suitors	7462
of	7462
queen	7462
penelope	7462
that	7462
i	7462
may	7462
speak	7463
even	7463
as	7463
i	7463
am	7463
minded	7463
a	7463
man	7463
knows	7463
neither	7463
ache	7463
nor	7463
pain	7463
if	7463
he	7463
gets	7464
hit	7464
while	7464
fighting	7464
for	7464
his	7464
money	7464
or	7464
for	7464
his	7464
sheep	7464
or	7464
his	7464
cattle	7464
and	7465
even	7465
so	7465
antinous	7465
has	7465
hit	7465
me	7465
while	7465
in	7465
the	7465
service	7465
of	7465
my	7465
miserable	7465
belly	7466
which	7466
is	7466
always	7466
getting	7466
people	7466
into	7466
trouble	7466
still	7466
if	7466
the	7466
poor	7467
have	7467
gods	7467
and	7467
avenging	7467
deities	7467
at	7467
all	7467
i	7467
pray	7467
them	7467
that	7467
antinous	7467
may	7468
come	7468
to	7468
a	7468
bad	7468
end	7468
before	7468
his	7468
marriage	7468
sit	7470
where	7470
you	7470
are	7470
and	7470
eat	7470
your	7470
victuals	7470
in	7470
silence	7470
or	7470
be	7470
off	7470
elsewhere	7470
shouted	7471
antinous	7471
if	7471
you	7471
say	7471
more	7471
i	7471
will	7471
have	7471
you	7471
dragged	7471
hand	7471
and	7471
foot	7472
through	7472
the	7472
courts	7472
and	7472
the	7472
servants	7472
shall	7472
flay	7472
you	7472
alive	7472
the	7474
other	7474
suitors	7474
were	7474
much	7474
displeased	7474
at	7474
this	7474
and	7474
one	7474
of	7474
the	7474
young	7474
men	7475
said	7475
antinous	7475
you	7475
did	7475
ill	7475
in	7475
striking	7475
that	7475
poor	7475
wretch	7475
of	7475
a	7475
tramp	7476
it	7476
will	7476
be	7476
worse	7476
for	7476
you	7476
if	7476
he	7476
should	7476
turn	7476
out	7476
to	7476
be	7476
some	7476
god	7476
and	7477
we	7477
know	7477
the	7477
gods	7477
go	7477
about	7477
disguised	7477
in	7477
all	7477
sorts	7477
of	7477
ways	7477
as	7477
people	7477
from	7478
foreign	7478
countries	7478
and	7478
travel	7478
about	7478
the	7478
world	7478
to	7478
see	7478
who	7478
do	7478
amiss	7478
and	7479
who	7479
righteously	7479
thus	7481
said	7481
the	7481
suitors	7481
but	7481
antinous	7481
paid	7481
them	7481
no	7481
heed	7481
meanwhile	7481
telemachus	7481
was	7482
furious	7482
about	7482
the	7482
blow	7482
that	7482
had	7482
been	7482
given	7482
to	7482
his	7482
father	7482
and	7482
though	7483
no	7483
tear	7483
fell	7483
from	7483
him	7483
he	7483
shook	7483
his	7483
head	7483
in	7483
silence	7483
and	7483
brooded	7483
on	7484
his	7484
revenge	7484
now	7486
when	7486
penelope	7486
heard	7486
that	7486
the	7486
beggar	7486
had	7486
been	7486
struck	7486
in	7486
the	7486
banqueting-cloister	7486

about	7549
the	7549
house	7549
without	7549

a	7550
blow	7550
that	7550

me	7550
very	7550
much	7550
but	7550
neither	7550

nor	7550
any	7550
one	7550
else	7551
defended	7551
me	7551

worn	7553
very	7553
thin	7553
you	7553

they	7553
are	7553
for	7553
you	7553
have	7553
seen	7553
them	7553
ever	7554
since	7554

first	7554
asked	7554
you	7554
to	7554
help	7554
me	7554
she	7554
can	7554
then	7554
ask	7554
me	7554
about	7554
the	7555
return	7555
of	7555
her	7555
husband	7555
the	7557
swineherd	7557

back	7557
when	7557
he	7557
heard	7557
this	7557
and	7557
penelope	7557
said	7557
as	7557
she	7557
saw	7558
him	7558
cross	7558
the	7558
threshold	7558
why	7558
do	7558
you	7558
not	7558
bring	7558
him	7558
here	7558
eumaeus	7558
is	7559
he	7559
afraid	7559
that	7559
some	7559
one	7559
will	7559
ill-treat	7559
him	7559
or	7559
is	7559
he	7559
shy	7559
of	7559
coming	7559
inside	7560
the	7560
house	7560
at	7560
all	7560
beggars	7560
should	7560
not	7560
be	7560
shamefaced	7560
to	7562
this	7562
you	7562
answered	7562
o	7562
swineherd	7562
eumaeus	7562
the	7562
stranger	7562
is	7562
quite	7562
reasonable	7563
he	7563
is	7563
avoiding	7563
the	7563
suitors	7563
and	7563
is	7563
only	7563
doing	7563
what	7563
any	7563
one	7564
else	7564
would	7564
do	7564
he	7564
asks	7564
you	7564
to	7564
wait	7564
till	7564
sundown	7564
and	7564
it	7564
will	7564
be	7564
much	7565
better	7565
madam	7565
that	7565
you	7565
should	7565
have	7565
him	7565
all	7565
to	7565
yourself	7565
when	7565
you	7566
can	7566
hear	7566
him	7566
and	7566
talk	7566
to	7566
him	7566
as	7566
you	7566
will	7566
the	7568
man	7568
is	7568
no	7568
fool	7568
answered	7568
penelope	7568
it	7568
would	7568
very	7568
likely	7568

he	7569
says	7569
for	7569
there	7569

the	7572
suitors	7572
for	7572
he	7572
had	7573
explained	7573
everything	7573
then	7573
he	7573
went	7573
up	7573
to	7573
telemachus	7573
and	7573
said	7573
in	7573
his	7574
ear	7574
so	7574
that	7574

overhear	7574
him	7574
my	7574

had	7596
no	7596

in	7596
him	7596
but	7596
he	7596
was	7596
a	7597
great	7597
hulking	7597
fellow	7597
to	7597

men	7598
of	7598
the	7598
place	7598
called	7598
him	7598
irus	7598

for	7599

on	7608
him	7608

said	7608
my	7608

not	7609
jealous	7609
there	7609
is	7609
room	7610
enough	7610
in	7610
this	7610
doorway	7610
for	7610
the	7610
pair	7610
of	7610
us	7610

yours	7611

seem	7611
to	7611
be	7611
just	7611
such	7611
another	7611
tramp	7612
as	7612
myself	7612
but	7612
perhaps	7612
the	7612

better	7612
luck	7612
by	7612

too	7613
much	7613
about	7613

or	7613
you	7613
will	7613
incense	7614
me	7614
and	7614
old	7614
though	7614
i	7614

your	7614

you	7618
filthy	7618
glutton	7618
you	7618
run	7618
on	7618
trippingly	7619
like	7619
an	7619
old	7619
fish-fag	7619
i	7619
have	7619
a	7619
good	7619
mind	7619
to	7619
lay	7619
both	7619
hands	7619
about	7620
you	7620
and	7620
knock	7620
your	7620
teeth	7620
out	7620
of	7620
your	7620
head	7620
like	7620
so	7620
many	7620
boar's	7620
tusks	7621
get	7621
ready	7621
therefore	7621
and	7621
let	7621
these	7621
people	7621
here	7621
stand	7621
by	7621
and	7621
look	7622
on	7622
you	7622
will	7622
never	7622
be	7622
able	7622
to	7622
fight	7622
one	7622
who	7622
is	7622
so	7622
much	7622
younger	7622
than	7623
yourself	7623
thus	7625
roundly	7625
did	7625
they	7625
rate	7625
one	7625
another	7625
on	7625
the	7625
smooth	7625
pavement	7625
in	7625
front	7625
of	7626
the	7626
doorway	7626
and	7626
when	7626
antinous	7626
saw	7626
what	7626
was	7626
going	7626
on	7626
he	7626
laughed	7626
heartily	7627
and	7627
said	7627
to	7627
the	7627
others	7627
this	7627
is	7627
the	7627
finest	7627
sport	7627
that	7627
you	7627
ever	7628
saw	7628
heaven	7628
never	7628
yet	7628
sent	7628
anything	7628

it	7628
into	7628
this	7628
house	7628
the	7629
stranger	7629

irus	7629
have	7629
quarreled	7629

going	7629
to	7629
fight	7629
let	7629
us	7629
set	7630
them	7630
on	7630
to	7630
do	7630
so	7630
at	7630
once	7630
the	7632
suitors	7632
all	7632
came	7632
up	7632
laughing	7632
and	7632
gathered	7632
round	7632
the	7632
two	7632
ragged	7632
tramps	7633
listen	7633
to	7633
me	7633
said	7633
antinous	7633
there	7633
are	7633
some	7633
goats	7633
paunches	7633
down	7634
at	7634
the	7634
fire	7634
which	7634
we	7634
have	7634
filled	7634
with	7634
blood	7634
and	7634
fat	7634
and	7634
set	7634
aside	7635
for	7635
supper	7635
he	7635
who	7635
is	7635
victorious	7635
and	7635
proves	7635
himself	7635
to	7635
be	7635
the	7635
better	7636

his	7636

the	7636

he	7636
shall	7636
be	7636
free	7636
of	7636
our	7636
table	7637

we	7637
will	7637
not	7637

any	7637
other	7637

about	7637
the	7637
house	7637
at	7637
all	7637
the	7639

my	7641
irrepressible	7641

urges	7641
me	7641
on	7641
though	7642
i	7642

any	7648
one	7648
here	7648
whoever	7648

about	7653
his	7653

up	7655
to	7655
him	7655
and	7655
made	7655
his	7655
limbs	7655
even	7655
stronger	7656
still	7656
the	7656
suitors	7656
were	7656
beyond	7656
measure	7656
astonished	7656
and	7656
one	7656
would	7657
turn	7657
towards	7657
his	7657
neighbour	7657
saying	7657
the	7657
stranger	7657
has	7657
brought	7657
such	7658
a	7658
thigh	7658
out	7658
of	7658
his	7658
old	7658
rags	7658
that	7658
there	7658
will	7658
soon	7658
be	7658
nothing	7658
left	7658
of	7659
irus	7659
irus	7661
began	7661
to	7661
be	7661
very	7661
uneasy	7661
as	7661
he	7661
heard	7661
them	7661
but	7661
the	7661
servants	7661
girded	7661
him	7662
by	7662
force	7662
and	7662
brought	7662
him	7662
into	7662
the	7662
open	7662
part	7662
of	7662
the	7662
court	7662
in	7662
such	7663
a	7663
fright	7663
that	7663
his	7663
limbs	7663
were	7663
all	7663
of	7663
a	7663
tremble	7663
antinous	7663
scolded	7663
him	7664
and	7664
said	7664
you	7664
swaggering	7664
bully	7664
you	7664
ought	7664
never	7664
to	7664
have	7664
been	7664
born	7665
at	7665
all	7665
if	7665
you	7665
are	7665
afraid	7665
of	7665
such	7665
an	7665
old	7665
broken-down	7665
creature	7665
as	7666
this	7666
tramp	7666
is	7666
i	7666
say	7666
therefore	7666
and	7666
it	7666
shall	7666
surely	7666
be	7666
if	7666
he	7666
beats	7667
you	7667
and	7667
proves	7667
himself	7667
the	7667
better	7667
man	7667
i	7667
shall	7667
pack	7667
you	7667
off	7667
on	7668
board	7668
ship	7668
to	7668
the	7668
mainland	7668
and	7668
send	7668
you	7668
to	7668
king	7668
echetus	7668
who	7668
kills	7668
every	7669
one	7669
that	7669
comes	7669
near	7669
him	7669
he	7669
will	7669
cut	7669
off	7669
your	7669
nose	7669
and	7669
ears	7669
and	7670
draw	7670
out	7670
your	7670
entrails	7670
for	7670
the	7670
dogs	7670
to	7670
eat	7670
this	7672
frightened	7672
irus	7672
still	7672
more	7672
but	7672
they	7672
brought	7672
him	7672
into	7672
the	7672
middle	7672
of	7673
the	7673
court	7673
and	7673
the	7673
two	7673
men	7673
raised	7673
their	7673
hands	7673
to	7673
fight	7673
then	7673
ulysses	7673
considered	7674
whether	7674
he	7674
should	7674
let	7674
drive	7674
so	7674
hard	7674
at	7674
him	7674
as	7674
to	7674
make	7674
an	7674
end	7675
of	7675
him	7675
then	7675
and	7675
there	7675
or	7675
whether	7675
he	7675
should	7675
give	7675
him	7675
a	7675
lighter	7675
blow	7676
that	7676
should	7676
only	7676
knock	7676
him	7676
down	7676
in	7676
the	7676
end	7676
he	7676
deemed	7676
it	7676
best	7676
to	7677
give	7677
the	7677
lighter	7677
blow	7677
for	7677
fear	7677
the	7677
achaeans	7677
should	7677
begin	7677
to	7677
suspect	7677
who	7678
he	7678
was	7678
then	7678
they	7678
began	7678
to	7678
fight	7678
and	7678
irus	7678
hit	7678
ulysses	7678
on	7678
the	7678
right	7679
shoulder	7679
but	7679
ulysses	7679
gave	7679
irus	7679
a	7679
blow	7679
on	7679
the	7679
neck	7679
under	7679
the	7679
ear	7680
that	7680
broke	7680
in	7680
the	7680
bones	7680
of	7680
his	7680
skull	7680
and	7680
the	7680
blood	7680
came	7680
gushing	7680
out	7681
of	7681
his	7681
mouth	7681
he	7681
fell	7681
groaning	7681
in	7681
the	7681
dust	7681
gnashing	7681
his	7681
teeth	7681
and	7682
kicking	7682
on	7682
the	7682
ground	7682
but	7682
the	7682
suitors	7682
threw	7682
up	7682
their	7682
hands	7682
and	7682
nearly	7683
died	7683
of	7683
laughter	7683
as	7683
ulysses	7683
caught	7683
hold	7683
of	7683
him	7683
by	7683
the	7683
foot	7683
and	7684
dragged	7684
him	7684
into	7684
the	7684
outer	7684
court	7684
as	7684
far	7684
as	7684
the	7684
gate-house	7684
there	7684
he	7685
propped	7685
him	7685
up	7685
against	7685
the	7685
wall	7685
and	7685
put	7685
his	7685
staff	7685
in	7685
his	7685
hands	7685
sit	7686
here	7686
said	7686
he	7686
and	7686
keep	7686
the	7686
dogs	7686
and	7686
pigs	7686
off	7686
you	7686
are	7686
a	7686
pitiful	7686
creature	7687
and	7687
if	7687
you	7687
try	7687
to	7687
make	7687
yourself	7687
king	7687
of	7687
the	7687
beggars	7687
any	7687
more	7688
you	7688
shall	7688
fare	7688
still	7688
worse	7688
then	7690
he	7690
threw	7690
his	7690
dirty	7690
old	7690
wallet	7690
all	7690
tattered	7690
and	7690
torn	7690
over	7690
his	7690
shoulder	7691
with	7691
the	7691
cord	7691
by	7691
which	7691
it	7691
hung	7691
and	7691
went	7691
back	7691
to	7691
sit	7691
down	7691
upon	7692
the	7692
threshold	7692
but	7692
the	7692
suitors	7692
went	7692
within	7692
the	7692
cloisters	7692
laughing	7692
and	7693
saluting	7693
him	7693
may	7693
jove	7693
and	7693
all	7693
the	7693
other	7693
gods	7693
said	7693
they	7693
grant	7693
you	7694
whatever	7694
you	7694
want	7694
for	7694
having	7694
put	7694
an	7694
end	7694
to	7694
the	7694
importunity	7694
of	7694
this	7695
insatiable	7695
tramp	7695
we	7695
will	7695
take	7695
him	7695
over	7695
to	7695
the	7695
mainland	7695
presently	7695
to	7696
king	7696
echetus	7696
who	7696
kills	7696
every	7696
one	7696
that	7696
comes	7696
near	7696
him	7696
ulysses	7698
hailed	7698
this	7698
as	7698
of	7698
good	7698
omen	7698
and	7698
antinous	7698
set	7698
a	7698
great	7698
goat's	7698
paunch	7699
before	7699
him	7699
filled	7699
with	7699
blood	7699
and	7699
fat	7699
amphinomus	7699
took	7699
two	7699
loaves	7699
out	7700
of	7700
the	7700
bread-basket	7700
and	7700
brought	7700
them	7700
to	7700
him	7700
pledging	7700
him	7700
as	7700
he	7700
did	7701
so	7701
in	7701
a	7701
golden	7701
goblet	7701
of	7701
wine	7701
good	7701
luck	7701
to	7701
you	7701
he	7701
said	7701
father	7701
stranger	7702
you	7702
are	7702
very	7702
badly	7702
off	7702
at	7702
present	7702
but	7702
i	7702
hope	7702
you	7702
will	7702
have	7702
better	7703
times	7703
by	7703
and	7703
by	7703
to	7705
this	7705
ulysses	7705
answered	7705
amphinomus	7705
you	7705
seem	7705
to	7705
be	7705
a	7705
man	7705
of	7705
good	7705
understanding	7706
as	7706
indeed	7706
you	7706
may	7706
well	7706
be	7706
seeing	7706
whose	7706
son	7706
you	7706
are	7706
i	7707
have	7707
heard	7707
your	7707
father	7707
well	7707
spoken	7707
of	7707
he	7707
is	7707
nisus	7707
of	7707
dulichium	7707
a	7708
man	7708
both	7708
brave	7708
and	7708
wealthy	7708
they	7708
tell	7708
me	7708
you	7708
are	7708
his	7708
son	7708
and	7708
you	7708
appear	7709
to	7709
be	7709
a	7709
considerable	7709
person	7709
listen	7709
therefore	7709
and	7709
take	7709
heed	7709
to	7710
what	7710
i	7710
am	7710
saying	7710
man	7710
is	7710
the	7710
vainest	7710
of	7710
all	7710
creatures	7710
that	7710
have	7710
their	7711
being	7711
upon	7711
earth	7711
as	7711
long	7711
as	7711
heaven	7711
vouchsafes	7711
him	7711
health	7711
and	7711
strength	7712
he	7712
thinks	7712
that	7712
he	7712
shall	7712
come	7712
to	7712
no	7712
harm	7712
hereafter	7712
and	7712
even	7712
when	7713
the	7713
blessed	7713
gods	7713
bring	7713
sorrow	7713
upon	7713
him	7713
he	7713
bears	7713
it	7713
as	7713
he	7713
needs	7713
must	7714
and	7714
makes	7714
the	7714
best	7714
of	7714
it	7714
for	7714
god	7714
almighty	7714

men	7714
their	7714
daily	7714
minds	7715
day	7715
by	7715
day	7715
i	7715
know	7715
all	7715
about	7715
it	7715
for	7715
i	7715
was	7715
a	7715
rich	7715
man	7715
once	7715
and	7716
did	7716
much	7716
wrong	7716
in	7716
the	7716
stubbornness	7716
of	7716
my	7716
pride	7716
and	7716
in	7716
the	7716
confidence	7716
that	7717
my	7717
father	7717
and	7717
my	7717
brothers	7717
would	7717
support	7717
me	7717
therefore	7717
let	7717
a	7717
man	7717
fear	7718
god	7718
in	7718
all	7718
things	7718
always	7718
and	7718
take	7718
the	7718
good	7718
that	7718
heaven	7718
may	7718
see	7718
fit	7719
to	7719
send	7719
him	7719
without	7719
vainglory	7719
consider	7719
the	7719
infamy	7719
of	7719
what	7719
these	7719
suitors	7720
are	7720
doing	7720
see	7720
how	7720
they	7720
are	7720
wasting	7720
the	7720
estate	7720
and	7720
doing	7720
dishonour	7721
to	7721
the	7721
wife	7721
of	7721
one	7721
who	7721
is	7721
certain	7721
to	7721
return	7721
some	7721
day	7721
and	7721
that	7722
too	7722
not	7722
long	7722
hence	7722
nay	7722
he	7722
will	7722
be	7722
here	7722
soon	7722
may	7722
heaven	7722
send	7722
you	7723
home	7723
quietly	7723
first	7723
that	7723
you	7723
may	7723
not	7723
meet	7723
with	7723
him	7723
in	7723
the	7723
day	7723
of	7723
his	7724
coming	7724
for	7724
once	7724
he	7724
is	7724
here	7724
the	7724
suitors	7724
and	7724
he	7724
will	7724
not	7724
part	7724
bloodlessly	7724
with	7726
these	7726
words	7726
he	7726
made	7726
a	7726
drink-offering	7726
and	7726
when	7726
he	7726
had	7726
drunk	7726
he	7726
put	7727
the	7727
gold	7727
cup	7727
again	7727
into	7727
the	7727
hands	7727
of	7727
amphinomus	7727
who	7727
walked	7727
away	7727
serious	7728
and	7728
bowing	7728
his	7728
head	7728
for	7728
he	7728
foreboded	7728
evil	7728
but	7728
even	7728
so	7728
he	7728
did	7729
not	7729
escape	7729
destruction	7729
for	7729
minerva	7729
had	7729
doomed	7729
him	7729
fall	7729
by	7729
the	7729
hand	7730
of	7730
telemachus	7730
so	7730
he	7730
took	7730
his	7730
seat	7730
again	7730
at	7730
the	7730
place	7730
from	7730
which	7730
he	7731
had	7731
come	7731
then	7733
minerva	7733
put	7733
it	7733
into	7733
the	7733
mind	7733
of	7733
penelope	7733
to	7733
show	7733
herself	7733
to	7733
the	7733
suitors	7734
that	7734
she	7734
might	7734
make	7734
them	7734
still	7734
more	7734
enamoured	7734
of	7734
her	7734
and	7734
win	7735
still	7735
further	7735
honour	7735
from	7735
her	7735
son	7735
and	7735
husband	7735
so	7735
she	7735
feigned	7735
a	7736
mocking	7736
laugh	7736
and	7736
said	7736
eurynome	7736
i	7736
have	7736
changed	7736
my	7736
and	7736
have	7736
a	7736
fancy	7737
to	7737
show	7737
myself	7737
to	7737
the	7737
suitors	7737
although	7737
i	7737
detest	7737
them	7737
i	7737
should	7737
like	7738
also	7738
to	7738
give	7738
my	7738
son	7738
a	7738
hint	7738
that	7738
he	7738
had	7738
better	7738
not	7738
have	7738
anything	7738
more	7739
to	7739
do	7739
with	7739
them	7739
they	7739
speak	7739
fairly	7739
enough	7739
but	7739
they	7739
mean	7739
mischief	7739
my	7741
dear	7741
child	7741
answered	7741
eurynome	7741
all	7741
that	7741
you	7741
have	7741
said	7741
is	7741
true	7741
go	7742
and	7742
tell	7742
your	7742
son	7742
about	7742
it	7742
but	7742
first	7742
wash	7742
yourself	7742
and	7742
anoint	7742
your	7743
face	7743
do	7743
not	7743
go	7743
about	7743
with	7743
your	7743
cheeks	7743
all	7743
covered	7743
with	7743
tears	7743
it	7744
is	7744
not	7744
right	7744
that	7744
you	7744
should	7744
grieve	7744
so	7744
incessantly	7744
for	7744
telemachus	7744
whom	7745
you	7745
always	7745
prayed	7745
that	7745
you	7745
might	7745
live	7745
to	7745
see	7745
with	7745
a	7745
beard	7745
is	7745
already	7746
grown	7746
up	7746
i	7748
know	7748
eurynome	7748
replied	7748
penelope	7748
that	7748
you	7748
mean	7748
well	7748
but	7748
do	7748
not	7749
try	7749
and	7749
persuade	7749
me	7749
to	7749
wash	7749
and	7749
to	7749
anoint	7749
myself	7749
for	7749
heaven	7749
robbed	7749
me	7750
of	7750
all	7750
my	7750
beauty	7750
on	7750
the	7750
day	7750
my	7750
husband	7750
sailed	7750
nevertheless	7750
tell	7750
autonoe	7751
and	7751
hippodamia	7751
that	7751
i	7751
want	7751
them	7751
they	7751
must	7751
be	7751
with	7751
me	7751
when	7751
i	7752
am	7752
in	7752
the	7752
cloister	7752
i	7752
am	7752
not	7752
going	7752
among	7752
the	7752
men	7752
alone	7752
it	7752
would	7752
not	7753
be	7753
proper	7753
for	7753
me	7753
to	7753
do	7753
so	7753
on	7755
this	7755
the	7755
old	7755
woman	7755
went	7755
out	7755
of	7755
the	7755
room	7755
to	7755
bid	7755
the	7755
maids	7755
go	7755
to	7755
their	7756
mistress	7756
in	7756
the	7756
meantime	7756
minerva	7756
bethought	7756
her	7756
of	7756
another	7756
matter	7756
and	7757
sent	7757
penelope	7757
off	7757
into	7757
a	7757
sweet	7757
slumber	7757
so	7757
she	7757
lay	7757
down	7757
on	7757
her	7757
couch	7758
and	7758
her	7758
limbs	7758
became	7758
heavy	7758
with	7758
sleep	7758
then	7758
the	7758
goddess	7758
shed	7758
grace	7759
and	7759
beauty	7759
over	7759
her	7759
that	7759
all	7759
the	7759
achaeans	7759
might	7759
admire	7759
her	7759
she	7760
washed	7760
her	7760
face	7760
with	7760
the	7760
ambrosial	7760
loveliness	7760
that	7760
venus	7760
wears	7760
when	7761
she	7761
goes	7761
dancing	7761
with	7761
the	7761
graces	7761
she	7761
made	7761
her	7761
taller	7761
and	7761
of	7761
a	7762
more	7762
commanding	7762
figure	7762
while	7762
as	7762
for	7762
her	7762
complexion	7762
it	7762
was	7762
whiter	7762
than	7763
sawn	7763
ivory	7763
when	7763
minerva	7763
had	7763
done	7763
all	7763
this	7763
she	7763
went	7763
away	7763
whereon	7763
the	7764
maids	7764
came	7764
in	7764
from	7764
the	7764
women's	7764
room	7764
and	7764
woke	7764
penelope	7764
with	7764
the	7764
sound	7765
of	7765
their	7765
talking	7765
what	7767
an	7767
exquisitely	7767
delicious	7767
sleep	7767

having	7767
said	7767
she	7767
as	7768
she	7768
passed	7768
her	7768
hands	7768
over	7768
her	7768
face	7768
in	7768
spite	7768
of	7768
all	7768
my	7768
misery	7768
i	7769
wish	7769
diana	7769
would	7769
let	7769
me	7769
die	7769
so	7769
sweetly	7769
now	7769
at	7769
this	7769
very	7769
moment	7769
that	7770
i	7770
might	7770
no	7770
longer	7770
waste	7770
in	7770
despair	7770
for	7770
the	7770
loss	7770
of	7770
my	7770
dear	7770
husband	7770
who	7771
possessed	7771
every	7771
kind	7771
of	7771
good	7771
quality	7771
and	7771
was	7771
the	7771
most	7771
distinguished	7771
man	7772
among	7772
the	7772
achaeans	7772
with	7774
these	7774
words	7774
she	7774
came	7774
down	7774
from	7774
her	7774
upper	7774
room	7774
not	7774
alone	7774
but	7774
attended	7775
by	7775
two	7775
of	7775
her	7775
maidens	7775
and	7775
when	7775
she	7775
reached	7775
the	7775
suitors	7775
she	7775
stood	7776
by	7776
one	7776
of	7776
the	7776
bearing-posts	7776
supporting	7776
the	7776
roof	7776
of	7776
the	7776
cloister	7776
holding	7777
a	7777
veil	7777
before	7777
her	7777
face	7777
and	7777
with	7777
a	7777
staid	7777
maid	7777
servant	7777
on	7777
either	7777
side	7778
of	7778
her	7778
as	7778
they	7778
beheld	7778
her	7778
the	7778
suitors	7778
were	7778
so	7778
overpowered	7778
and	7778
became	7779
so	7779
desperately	7779
enamoured	7779
of	7779
her	7779
that	7779
each	7779
one	7779
prayed	7779
he	7779
might	7779
win	7780
her	7780
for	7780
his	7780
own	7780
bed	7780
fellow	7780
telemachus	7782
said	7782
she	7782
addressing	7782
her	7782
son	7782
i	7782
fear	7782
you	7782
are	7782
no	7782
longer	7782
so	7783
discreet	7783
and	7783
well	7783
conducted	7783
as	7783
you	7783
used	7783
to	7783
be	7783
when	7783
you	7783
were	7783
younger	7783
you	7784
had	7784
a	7784
greater	7784
sense	7784
of	7784
propriety	7784
now	7784
however	7784
that	7784
you	7784
are	7784
grown	7784
up	7785
though	7785
a	7785
stranger	7785
to	7785
look	7785
at	7785
you	7785
would	7785
take	7785
you	7785
for	7785
the	7785
son	7785
of	7785
a	7786
well-to-do	7786
father	7786
as	7786
far	7786
as	7786
size	7786
and	7786
good	7786
looks	7786
go	7786
your	7786
conduct	7786
is	7787
by	7787
no	7787
means	7787
what	7787
it	7787
should	7787
be	7787
what	7787
is	7787
all	7787
this	7787
disturbance	7787
that	7787
has	7788
been	7788
going	7788
on	7788
and	7788
how	7788
came	7788
you	7788
to	7788
allow	7788
a	7788
stranger	7788
to	7788
be	7788
so	7788
disgracefully	7788
ill-treated	7789
what	7789
would	7789
have	7789
happened	7789
if	7789
he	7789
had	7789
suffered	7789
serious	7789
injury	7789
while	7790
a	7790
suppliant	7790
in	7790
our	7790
house	7790
surely	7790
this	7790
would	7790
have	7790
been	7790
very	7790
discreditable	7790
to	7791
you	7791
i	7793
am	7793
not	7793
surprised	7793
my	7793
dear	7793
mother	7793
at	7793
your	7793
displeasure	7793
replied	7793
telemachus	7794
i	7794
understand	7794
all	7794
about	7794
it	7794
and	7794
know	7794
when	7794
things	7794
are	7794
not	7794
as	7795
they	7795
should	7795
be	7795
which	7795
i	7795
could	7795
not	7795
do	7795
when	7795
i	7795
was	7795
younger	7795
i	7795
cannot	7795
however	7796
behave	7796
with	7796
perfect	7796
propriety	7796
at	7796
all	7796
times	7796
first	7796
one	7796
and	7796
then	7797
another	7797
of	7797
these	7797
wicked	7797
people	7797
here	7797
keeps	7797
driving	7797
me	7797
out	7797
of	7797
my	7797
mind	7798
and	7798
i	7798
have	7798
no	7798
one	7798
to	7798
stand	7798
by	7798
me	7798
after	7798
all	7798
however	7798
this	7798
fight	7798
between	7799
irus	7799
and	7799
the	7799
stranger	7799
did	7799
not	7799
turn	7799
out	7799
as	7799
the	7799
suitors	7799
meant	7799
it	7800
to	7800
do	7800
for	7800
the	7800
stranger	7800
got	7800
the	7800
best	7800
of	7800
it	7800
i	7800
wish	7800
father	7800
jove	7800
minerva	7801
and	7801
apollo	7801
would	7801
break	7801
the	7801
neck	7801
of	7801
every	7801
one	7801
of	7801
these	7801
wooers	7801
of	7802
yours	7802
some	7802
inside	7802
the	7802
house	7802
and	7802
some	7802
out	7802
and	7802
i	7802
wish	7802
they	7802
might	7802
all	7803
be	7803
as	7803
limp	7803
as	7803
irus	7803
is	7803
over	7803
yonder	7803
in	7803
the	7803
gate	7803
of	7803
the	7803
outer	7803
court	7803
see	7804
how	7804
he	7804
nods	7804
his	7804
head	7804
like	7804
a	7804
drunken	7804
man	7804
he	7804
has	7804
had	7804
such	7804
a	7804
thrashing	7804
that	7805
he	7805
cannot	7805
stand	7805
on	7805
his	7805
feet	7805
nor	7805
get	7805
back	7805
to	7805
his	7805
home	7805
wherever	7805
that	7806
may	7806
be	7806
for	7806
has	7806
no	7806
strength	7806
left	7806
in	7806
him	7806
thus	7808
did	7808
they	7808
converse	7808
eurymachus	7808
then	7808
came	7808
up	7808
and	7808
said	7808
queen	7808
penelope	7808
daughter	7809
of	7809
icarius	7809
if	7809
all	7809
the	7809
achaeans	7809
in	7809
iasian	7809
argos	7809
could	7809
see	7809
you	7810
at	7810
this	7810
moment	7810
you	7810
would	7810
have	7810
still	7810
more	7810
suitors	7810
in	7810
your	7810
house	7810
by	7811
tomorrow	7811
morning	7811
for	7811
you	7811
are	7811
the	7811
most	7811
admirable	7811
woman	7811
in	7811
the	7811
whole	7811
world	7812
both	7812
as	7812
regards	7812
personal	7812
beauty	7812
and	7812
strength	7812
of	7812
understanding	7812
to	7814
this	7814
penelope	7814
replied	7814
eurymachus	7814
heaven	7814
robbed	7814
me	7814
of	7814
all	7814
my	7814
beauty	7815
whether	7815
of	7815
face	7815
or	7815
figure	7815
when	7815
the	7815
argives	7815
set	7815
sail	7815
for	7815
troy	7815
and	7816
my	7816
dear	7816
husband	7816
with	7816
them	7816
if	7816
he	7816
were	7816
to	7816
return	7816
and	7816
look	7816
after	7816
my	7817
affairs	7817
i	7817
should	7817
both	7817
be	7817
more	7817
respected	7817
and	7817
show	7817
a	7817
better	7817
presence	7817
to	7818
the	7818
world	7818
as	7818
it	7818
is	7818
i	7818
am	7818
oppressed	7818
with	7818
care	7818
and	7818
with	7818
the	7818
afflictions	7818
which	7819
heaven	7819
has	7819
seen	7819
fit	7819
to	7819
heap	7819
upon	7819
me	7819
my	7819
husband	7819
foresaw	7819
it	7819
all	7819
and	7820
when	7820
he	7820
was	7820
leaving	7820
home	7820
he	7820
took	7820
my	7820
right	7820
wrist	7820
in	7820
his	7820
hand	7820
wife	7820
he	7821
said	7821
we	7821
shall	7821
not	7821
all	7821
of	7821
us	7821
come	7821
safe	7821
home	7821
from	7821
troy	7821
for	7821
the	7821
trojans	7822
fight	7822
well	7822
both	7822
with	7822
bow	7822
and	7822
spear	7822
they	7822
are	7822
excellent	7822
also	7822
at	7823
fighting	7823
from	7823
chariots	7823
and	7823
nothing	7823
decides	7823
the	7823
issue	7823
of	7823
a	7823
fight	7823
sooner	7824
than	7824
this	7824
i	7824
know	7824
not	7824
therefore	7824
whether	7824
heaven	7824
will	7824
send	7824
me	7825
back	7825
to	7825
you	7825
or	7825
whether	7825
i	7825
may	7825
not	7825
fall	7825
over	7825
there	7825
at	7825
troy	7825
in	7825
the	7825
meantime	7826
do	7826
you	7826
look	7826
after	7826
things	7826
here	7826
take	7826
care	7826
of	7826
my	7826
father	7826
and	7826
mother	7827
as	7827
at	7827
present	7827
and	7827
even	7827
more	7827
so	7827
during	7827
my	7827
absence	7827
but	7827
when	7827
you	7828
see	7828
our	7828
son	7828
growing	7828
a	7828
beard	7828
then	7828
marry	7828
whom	7828
you	7828
will	7828
and	7828
leave	7828
this	7829
your	7829
present	7829
home	7829
this	7829
is	7829
what	7829
he	7829
said	7829
and	7829
now	7829
it	7829
is	7829
all	7829
coming	7829
true	7830
a	7830
night	7830
will	7830
come	7830
when	7830
i	7830
shall	7830
have	7830
to	7830
yield	7830
myself	7830
to	7830
a	7830
marriage	7830
which	7831
i	7831
detest	7831
for	7831
jove	7831

taken	7831
from	7831
me	7831
all	7831
hope	7831
of	7831
happiness	7831
this	7832
further	7832
grief	7832
moreover	7832
cuts	7832
me	7832
to	7832
the	7832
very	7832
heart	7832
you	7832
suitors	7832
are	7833
not	7833
wooing	7833
me	7833
after	7833
the	7833
custom	7833
of	7833
my	7833
country	7833
when	7833
men	7833
are	7833
courting	7833
a	7834
woman	7834

be	7834
a	7834
good	7834

who	7834
is	7834
of	7834
noble	7834

trying	7835
to	7835
win	7835
her	7835
for	7835

usually	7836
bring	7836
oxen	7836
and	7836
sheep	7836
to	7836
feast	7836
the	7836
friends	7836
of	7836
the	7836
lady	7836
and	7836
they	7837
make	7837
her	7837
magnificent	7837
presents	7837
instead	7837
of	7837
eating	7837
up	7837
other	7837
people's	7837
property	7838
without	7838
paying	7838
for	7838
it	7838
this	7840
was	7840
what	7840
she	7840
said	7840
and	7840
ulysses	7840
was	7840
glad	7840
when	7840
he	7840
heard	7840
her	7840
trying	7840
to	7841
get	7841
presents	7841
out	7841
of	7841
the	7841
suitors	7841

flattering	7841
them	7841
with	7841
fair	7841
words	7842
which	7842
he	7842
knew	7842
she	7842
did	7842
not	7842

give	7845
them	7845
to	7845
you	7845

is	7846
not	7846
well	7846
to	7846
refuse	7846
a	7846

but	7846
we	7846

him	8134
in	8134
amnisus	8134
off	8134
the	8134
cave	8135
of	8135
ilithuia	8135
where	8135
the	8135
harbours	8135
are	8135
difficult	8135
to	8135
enter	8135
and	8135
he	8135
could	8136
hardly	8136
find	8136
shelter	8136
from	8136
the	8136
winds	8136
that	8136
were	8136
then	8136
xaging	8136
as	8136
soon	8137
as	8137
he	8137
got	8137
there	8137
he	8137
went	8137
into	8137
the	8137
town	8137
and	8137
asked	8137
for	8137
idomeneus	8137
claiming	8138
to	8138
be	8138
his	8138
old	8138
and	8138
valued	8138
friend	8138
but	8138
idomeneus	8138
had	8138
already	8138
set	8139
sail	8139
for	8139
troy	8139
some	8139
ten	8139
or	8139
twelve	8139
days	8139
earlier	8139
so	8139
i	8139
took	8139
him	8139
to	8139
my	8140
own	8140
house	8140
and	8140
showed	8140
him	8140
every	8140
kind	8140
of	8140
hospitality	8140
for	8140
i	8140
had	8140
abundance	8140
of	8141
everything	8141
moreover	8141
i	8141
fed	8141
the	8141
men	8141
who	8141
were	8141
with	8141
him	8141
with	8141
barley	8141
meal	8142
from	8142
the	8142
public	8142
store	8142
and	8142
got	8142
subscriptions	8142
of	8142
wine	8142
and	8142
oxen	8142
for	8143
them	8143
to	8143
sacrifice	8143
to	8143
their	8143
heart's	8143
content	8143
they	8143
stayed	8143
with	8143
me	8143
twelve	8144
days	8144
for	8144
there	8144
was	8144
a	8144
gale	8144
blowing	8144
from	8144
the	8144
north	8144
so	8144
strong	8144
that	8145
one	8145
could	8145
hardly	8145
keep	8145
one's	8145
feet	8145
on	8145
land	8145
i	8145
suppose	8145
some	8145
unfriendly	8145
god	8146
had	8146
raised	8146
it	8146
for	8146
them	8146
but	8146
on	8146
the	8146
thirteenth	8146
day	8146
the	8146
wind	8146
dropped	8146
and	8147
they	8147
got	8147
away	8147
many	8149
a	8149
plausible	8149
tale	8149
did	8149
ulysses	8149
further	8149
tell	8149
her	8149
and	8149
penelope	8149
wept	8149
as	8150
she	8150
listened	8150
for	8150
her	8150
heart	8150
was	8150
melted	8150
as	8150
the	8150
snow	8150
wastes	8150
upon	8150
the	8151
mountain	8151
tops	8151
when	8151
the	8151
winds	8151
from	8151
south	8151
east	8151
and	8151
west	8151
have	8151
breathed	8151
upon	8152
it	8152
and	8152
thawed	8152
it	8152
till	8152
the	8152
rivers	8152
run	8152
bank	8152
full	8152
with	8152
water	8152
even	8152
so	8153
did	8153
her	8153
cheeks	8153
overflow	8153
with	8153
tears	8153
for	8153
the	8153
husband	8153
who	8153
was	8153
all	8153
the	8154
time	8154
sitting	8154
by	8154
her	8154
side	8154
ulysses	8154
felt	8154
for	8154
her	8154
and	8154
was	8154
for	8154
her	8154
but	8155
he	8155
kept	8155
his	8155
eyes	8155
as	8155
hard	8155
as	8155
or	8155
iron	8155
without	8155
letting	8155
them	8155
so	8155
much	8155
as	8156
quiver	8156
so	8156
cunningly	8156
did	8156
he	8156
restrain	8156
his	8156
tears	8156
then	8156
when	8156
she	8156
had	8157
relieved	8157
herself	8157
by	8157
weeping	8157
she	8157
turned	8157
to	8157
him	8157
again	8157
and	8157
said	8157
now	8158
stranger	8158
i	8158
shall	8158
put	8158
you	8158
to	8158
the	8158
test	8158
and	8158
see	8158
whether	8158
or	8158
no	8158
you	8159
really	8159
did	8159
entertain	8159
my	8159
husband	8159
and	8159
his	8159
men	8159
as	8159
you	8159
say	8159
you	8159
did	8159
tell	8160
me	8160
then	8160
how	8160
he	8160
was	8160
dressed	8160
what	8160
kind	8160
of	8160
a	8160
man	8160
he	8160
was	8160
to	8160
look	8160
at	8161
and	8161
so	8161
also	8161
with	8161
his	8161
companions	8161
madam	8163
answered	8163
ulysses	8163
it	8163
is	8163
such	8163
a	8163
long	8163
time	8163
ago	8163
that	8163
i	8163
can	8163
hardly	8164
say	8164
twenty	8164
years	8164
are	8164
come	8164
and	8164
gone	8164
since	8164
he	8164
left	8164
my	8164
home	8164
and	8165
went	8165
elsewhither	8165
but	8165
i	8165
will	8165
tell	8165
you	8165
as	8165
well	8165
as	8165
i	8165
can	8165
recollect	8165
ulysses	8166
wore	8166
a	8166
mantle	8166
of	8166
purple	8166
wool	8166
double	8166
lined	8166
and	8166
it	8166
was	8166
fastened	8166
by	8167
a	8167
gold	8167
brooch	8167
with	8167
two	8167
catches	8167
for	8167
the	8167
pin	8167
on	8167
the	8167
face	8167
of	8167
this	8167
there	8168
was	8168
a	8168
device	8168
that	8168
showed	8168
a	8168
dog	8168
holding	8168
a	8168
spotted	8168
fawn	8168
between	8168
his	8169
fore	8169
paws	8169
and	8169
watching	8169
it	8169
as	8169
it	8169
lay	8169
panting	8169
upon	8169
the	8169
ground	8169
every	8170
one	8170
marvelled	8170
at	8170
the	8170
way	8170
in	8170
which	8170
these	8170
things	8170
had	8170
been	8170
done	8170
in	8171
gold	8171
the	8171
dog	8171
looking	8171
at	8171
the	8171
fawn	8171
and	8171
strangling	8171
it	8171
while	8171
the	8171
fawn	8172
was	8172
struggling	8172
convulsively	8172
to	8172
escape	8172
as	8172
for	8172
the	8172
shirt	8172
that	8172
he	8173
wore	8173
next	8173
his	8173
skin	8173
it	8173
was	8173
so	8173
soft	8173
that	8173
it	8173
fitted	8173
him	8173
like	8173
the	8173
skin	8174
of	8174
an	8174
onion	8174
and	8174
glistened	8174
in	8174
the	8174
sunlight	8174
to	8174
the	8174
admiration	8174
of	8175
all	8175
the	8175
women	8175
who	8175
beheld	8175
it	8175
furthermore	8175
i	8175
say	8175
and	8175
lay	8175
my	8175
saying	8175
to	8176
your	8176
heart	8176
that	8176
i	8176
do	8176
not	8176
know	8176
whether	8176
ulysses	8176
wore	8176
these	8176
clothes	8176
when	8177
he	8177
left	8177
home	8177
or	8177
whether	8177
one	8177
of	8177
his	8177
companions	8177
had	8177
given	8177
them	8177
to	8178
him	8178
while	8178
he	8178
was	8178
on	8178
his	8178
voyage	8178
or	8178
possibly	8178
some	8178
one	8178
at	8178
whose	8178
house	8178
he	8179
was	8179
staying	8179
made	8179
him	8179
a	8179
present	8179
of	8179
them	8179
for	8179
he	8179
was	8179
a	8179
man	8179
of	8179
many	8179
friends	8180
and	8180
had	8180
few	8180
equals	8180
among	8180
the	8180
achaeans	8180
i	8180
myself	8180
gave	8180
him	8180
a	8180
sword	8181
of	8181
bronze	8181
and	8181
a	8181
beautiful	8181
purple	8181
mantle	8181
double	8181
lined	8181
with	8181
a	8182
shirt	8182
that	8182
went	8182
down	8182
to	8182
his	8182
feet	8182
and	8182
i	8182
sent	8182
him	8182
on	8182
board	8182
his	8182
ship	8182
with	8183
every	8183
mark	8183
of	8183
honour	8183
he	8183
had	8183
a	8183
servant	8183
with	8183
him	8183
a	8183
little	8183
older	8183
than	8184
himself	8184
and	8184
i	8184
can	8184
tell	8184
you	8184
what	8184
he	8184
was	8184
like	8184
his	8184
shoulders	8184
were	8184
hunched	8185
he	8185
was	8185
dark	8185
and	8185
he	8185
had	8185
thick	8185
curly	8185
hair	8185
his	8185
name	8185
was	8185
eurybates	8185
and	8186
ulysses	8186
treated	8186
him	8186
with	8186
greater	8186
familiarity	8186
than	8186
he	8186
did	8186
any	8186
of	8186
the	8187
others	8187
as	8187
being	8187
the	8187
most	8187
like-minded	8187
with	8187
himself	8187
penelope	8189
was	8189
moved	8189
still	8189
more	8189
deeply	8189
as	8189
she	8189
heard	8189
the	8189
indisputable	8189
proofs	8190
that	8190
ulysses	8190
laid	8190
before	8190
her	8190
and	8190
when	8190
she	8190
had	8190
again	8190
found	8190
relief	8191
in	8191
tears	8191
she	8191
said	8191
to	8191
him	8191
stranger	8191
i	8191
was	8191
already	8191
disposed	8191
to	8192
pity	8192
you	8192
but	8192
henceforth	8192
you	8192
shall	8192
be	8192
honoured	8192
and	8192
made	8192
welcome	8192
in	8193
my	8193
house	8193
it	8193
was	8193
i	8193
who	8193
gave	8193
ulysses	8193
the	8193
clothes	8193
you	8193
speak	8193
of	8193
i	8193
took	8194
them	8194
out	8194
of	8194
the	8194
store	8194
room	8194
and	8194
folded	8194
them	8194
up	8194
myself	8194
and	8194
i	8194
gave	8194
him	8195
also	8195
the	8195
gold	8195
brooch	8195
to	8195
wear	8195
as	8195
an	8195
ornament	8195
alas	8195
i	8195
shall	8195
never	8195
welcome	8196
him	8196
home	8196
again	8196
it	8196
was	8196
by	8196
an	8196
ill	8196
fate	8196
that	8196
he	8196
ever	8196
set	8196
out	8196
for	8197
that	8197
detested	8197
city	8197
whose	8197
very	8197
name	8197
i	8197
cannot	8197
bring	8197
myself	8197
even	8197
to	8198
mention	8198
then	8200
ulysses	8200
answered	8200
madam	8200
wife	8200
of	8200
ulysses	8200
do	8200
not	8200
disfigure	8200
yourself	8200
further	8201
by	8201
grieving	8201
thus	8201
bitterly	8201
for	8201
your	8201
loss	8201
though	8201
i	8201
can	8201
hardly	8201
blame	8202
you	8202
for	8202
doing	8202
so	8202
a	8202
woman	8202
who	8202
has	8202
loved	8202
her	8202
husband	8202
and	8202
borne	8202
him	8203
children	8203
would	8203
naturally	8203
be	8203
grieved	8203
at	8203
losing	8203
him	8203
even	8203
though	8203
he	8204
were	8204
a	8204
worse	8204
man	8204
than	8204
ulysses	8204
who	8204
they	8204
say	8204
was	8204
like	8204
a	8204
god	8204
still	8204
cease	8205
your	8205
tears	8205
and	8205
listen	8205
to	8205
what	8205
i	8205
can	8205
tell	8205
i	8205
will	8205
hide	8205
nothing	8205
from	8206
you	8206
and	8206
can	8206
say	8206
with	8206
perfect	8206
truth	8206
that	8206
i	8206
have	8206
lately	8206
heard	8206
of	8207
ulysses	8207
as	8207
being	8207
alive	8207
and	8207
on	8207
his	8207
way	8207
home	8207
he	8207
is	8207
among	8207
the	8207
thesprotians	8207
and	8208
is	8208
bringing	8208
back	8208
much	8208
valuable	8208
treasure	8208
that	8208
he	8208
has	8208
begged	8208
from	8208
one	8209
and	8209
another	8209
of	8209
them	8209
but	8209
his	8209
ship	8209
and	8209
all	8209
his	8209
crew	8209
were	8209
lost	8209
as	8209
they	8210
were	8210
leaving	8210
the	8210
thrinacian	8210
island	8210
for	8210
jove	8210
and	8210
the	8210
sun-god	8210
were	8211
angry	8211
with	8211
him	8211
because	8211
his	8211
men	8211
had	8211
slaughtered	8211
the	8211
sun-god's	8211
cattle	8212
and	8212
they	8212
were	8212
all	8212
drowned	8212
to	8212
a	8212
man	8212
but	8212
ulysses	8212
stuck	8212
to	8212
the	8212
keel	8213
of	8213
the	8213
ship	8213
and	8213
was	8213
drifted	8213
on	8213
to	8213
the	8213
land	8213
of	8213
the	8213
phaecians	8213
who	8214
are	8214
near	8214
of	8214
kin	8214
to	8214
the	8214
immortals	8214
and	8214
who	8214
treated	8214
him	8214
as	8214
though	8214
he	8215
had	8215
been	8215
a	8215
god	8215
giving	8215
him	8215
many	8215
presents	8215
and	8215
wishing	8215
to	8215
escort	8215
him	8216
home	8216
safe	8216
and	8216
sound	8216
in	8216
fact	8216
ulysses	8216
would	8216
have	8216
been	8216
here	8216
long	8216
ago	8217
had	8217
he	8217

to	8220
me	8220
making	8220
drink-offerings	8220
in	8220
his	8220
house	8220
as	8220
he	8220
did	8221
so	8221
that	8221
the	8221

take	8222
ulysses	8222
to	8222
his	8222

me	8224
all	8224
treasure	8224
ulysses	8224

from	8227
the	8227
high	8227
oak	8227

an	8228
absence	8228
he	8228
should	8228
return	8228

here	8229
shortly	8229
he	8229
is	8229

cannot	8230
remain	8230
away	8230

such	8269
admirable	8269
propriety	8269

in	8271
her	8271

woman	8277
covered	8277
her	8277
face	8277
with	8277
her	8277
hands	8277
she	8277
began	8278
to	8278
weep	8278
and	8278
made	8278
lamentation	8278
saying	8278
my	8278
dear	8278

with	8279
you	8279
i	8279

one	8279

ever	8279
more	8279
god-fearing	8280
than	8280
yourself	8280
and	8280
yet	8280
jove	8280

you	8280
no	8280
one	8280

when	8282
you	8282

to	8282
a	8282
green	8282

prevented	8283
you	8283
alone	8284
from	8284
ever	8284
getting	8284
back	8284
to	8284
your	8284
own	8284
home	8284
i	8284
have	8284
no	8284
doubt	8284
the	8284
women	8285
in	8285
some	8285
foreign	8285
palace	8285
which	8285
ulysses	8285

got	8285
to	8285

gibing	8285
at	8285
him	8286
as	8286
all	8286
these	8286
sluts	8286
here	8286
have	8286
been	8286
gibing	8286
you	8286
i	8286
do	8286
not	8286
wonder	8286
at	8287
your	8287
not	8287
choosing	8287
to	8287
let	8287
them	8287
wash	8287
you	8287
after	8287
the	8287
manner	8287
in	8287
which	8287
they	8288
have	8288
insulted	8288
you	8288
i	8288
will	8288
wash	8288
your	8288
feet	8288
myself	8288
gladly	8288
enough	8288
as	8289
penelope	8289
has	8289
said	8289
that	8289
i	8289
am	8289
to	8289
do	8289
so	8289
i	8289
will	8289
wash	8289
them	8289
both	8289
for	8289
penelope's	8290
sake	8290
and	8290
for	8290
your	8290
own	8290
for	8290
you	8290
have	8290
raised	8290
the	8290
most	8290
lively	8290
feelings	8291
of	8291
compassion	8291
in	8291
my	8291
mind	8291
and	8291
let	8291
me	8291
say	8291
this	8291
moreover	8291
which	8291
pray	8292
attend	8292
to	8292
we	8292
have	8292
had	8292
all	8292
kinds	8292
of	8292
strangers	8292
in	8292
distress	8292
come	8292
here	8293
before	8293
now	8293
but	8293
i	8293
make	8293
bold	8293
to	8293
say	8293
that	8293
no	8293
one	8293
ever	8293
yet	8293
came	8293
who	8294
was	8294
so	8294
like	8294
ulysses	8294
in	8294
figure	8294
voice	8294
and	8294
feet	8294
as	8294
you	8294
are	8294
those	8296
who	8296
have	8296
seen	8296
us	8296
both	8296
answered	8296
ulysses	8296
have	8296
always	8296
said	8296
we	8297
were	8297
wonderfully	8297
like	8297
each	8297
other	8297
and	8297
now	8297
you	8297
have	8297
noticed	8297
it	8297
too	8297
then	8299
the	8299
old	8299
woman	8299
took	8299
the	8299
cauldron	8299
in	8299
which	8299
she	8299
was	8299
going	8299
to	8299
wash	8299
his	8300
feet	8300
and	8300
poured	8300
plenty	8300
of	8300
cold	8300
water	8300
into	8300
it	8300
adding	8300
hot	8300
till	8300
the	8301
bath	8301
was	8301
warm	8301
enough	8301
ulysses	8301
sat	8301
by	8301
the	8301
fire	8301
but	8301
ere	8301
long	8301
he	8301
turned	8302
away	8302
from	8302
the	8302
light	8302
for	8302
it	8302
occurred	8302
to	8302
him	8302
that	8302
when	8302
the	8302
old	8302
woman	8303
had	8303
hold	8303
of	8303
his	8303
leg	8303
she	8303
would	8303
recognize	8303
a	8303
certain	8303
scar	8303
which	8303
it	8304
bore	8304
whereon	8304
the	8304
whole	8304
truth	8304
would	8304
come	8304
out	8304
and	8304
indeed	8304
as	8304
soon	8304
as	8305
she	8305
began	8305
washing	8305
her	8305
master	8305
she	8305
at	8305
once	8305
knew	8305
the	8305
scar	8305
as	8305
one	8305
that	8306
had	8306
been	8306
given	8306
him	8306
by	8306
a	8306
wild	8306
boar	8306
when	8306
he	8306
was	8306
hunting	8306
on	8306
mount	8306
parnassus	8307
with	8307
his	8307
excellent	8307
grandfather	8307
autolycus	8307
who	8307
was	8307
the	8307
most	8307
accomplished	8308
thief	8308
and	8308
perjurer	8308
in	8308
the	8308
whole	8308
world	8308
and	8308
with	8308
the	8308
sons	8308
of	8309
autolycus	8309
mercury	8309
himself	8309
had	8309
endowed	8309
him	8309
with	8309
this	8309
gift	8309
for	8309
he	8310
used	8310
to	8310
burn	8310
the	8310
thigh	8310
bones	8310
of	8310
goats	8310
and	8310
kids	8310
to	8310
him	8310
so	8310
he	8310
took	8310
pleasure	8311
in	8311
his	8311
companionship	8311
it	8311
happened	8311
once	8311
that	8311
autolycus	8311
had	8311
gone	8312
to	8312
ithaca	8312
and	8312
had	8312
found	8312
the	8312
child	8312
of	8312
his	8312
daughter	8312
just	8312
born	8312
as	8313

his	8313
knees	8313
and	8314
said	8314

a	8314
name	8314
for	8314
your	8314

child	8317
thus	8317
i	8318
am	8318
highly	8318
displeased	8318
with	8318
a	8318
large	8318
number	8318
of	8318
people	8318
in	8318
one	8318
place	8318

or	8319
the	8319
child	8320
of	8320

when	8320
he	8320
grows	8320
up	8320
and	8320
comes	8320
to	8320
visit	8320
his	8320
mother's	8320
family	8320
on	8321
mount	8321

where	8321

send	8322
him	8322
on	8322
his	8322
way	8322
rejoicing	8322

went	8324
to	8324
parnassus	8324
to	8324
get	8324
the	8324
presents	8324
from	8324
autolycus	8324
who	8325
with	8325
his	8325
sons	8325
shook	8325
hands	8325
with	8325
him	8325
and	8325
gave	8325
him	8325
welcome	8325
his	8325
grandmother	8325
amphithea	8326
threw	8326
her	8326
arms	8326
about	8326
him	8326
and	8326
kissed	8326
his	8326
head	8326
and	8326
both	8326
his	8327
beautiful	8327
eyes	8327
while	8327
autolycus	8327
desired	8327
his	8327
sons	8327
to	8327
get	8327
dinner	8327
ready	8328
and	8328
they	8328
did	8328
as	8328
he	8328
told	8328
them	8328
they	8328
brought	8328
in	8328
a	8328
five	8328
year	8328
old	8328
bull	8329
flayed	8329
it	8329
made	8329
it	8329
ready	8329
and	8329
divided	8329
it	8329
into	8329
joints	8329
these	8329
they	8329
then	8330
cut	8330
carefully	8330
up	8330
into	8330
smaller	8330
pieces	8330
and	8330
spitted	8330
them	8330
they	8330
roasted	8330
them	8331
sufficiently	8331
and	8331
served	8331
the	8331
portions	8331
round	8331
thus	8331
through	8331
the	8331
livelong	8332
day	8332
to	8332
the	8332
going	8332
down	8332
of	8332
the	8332
sun	8332
they	8332
feasted	8332
and	8332
every	8332
man	8333
had	8333
his	8333
full	8333
share	8333
so	8333
that	8333
all	8333
were	8333
satisfied	8333
but	8333
when	8333
the	8333
sun	8333
set	8334
and	8334
it	8334
came	8334
on	8334
dark	8334
they	8334
went	8334
to	8334
bed	8334
and	8334
enjoyed	8334
the	8334
boon	8334
of	8334
sleep	8335
when	8337
the	8337
child	8337
of	8337
morning	8337
rosy-fingered	8337
dawn	8337
appeared	8337
the	8337
sons	8337
of	8338
autolycus	8338
went	8338
out	8338
with	8338
their	8338
hounds	8338
hunting	8338
and	8338
ulysses	8338
went	8338
too	8339
they	8339
climbed	8339
the	8339
wooded	8339
slopes	8339
of	8339
parnassus	8339
and	8339
soon	8339
reached	8339
its	8340
breezy	8340
upland	8340
valleys	8340
but	8340
as	8340
the	8340
sun	8340
was	8340
beginning	8340
to	8340
beat	8340
upon	8340
the	8341
fields	8341
fresh-risen	8341
from	8341
the	8341
slow	8341
still	8341
currents	8341
of	8341
oceanus	8341
they	8341
came	8342
to	8342
a	8342
mountain	8342
dell	8342
the	8342
dogs	8342
were	8342
in	8342
front	8342
searching	8342
for	8342
the	8342
tracks	8343
of	8343
the	8343
beast	8343
they	8343
were	8343
chasing	8343
and	8343
after	8343
them	8343
came	8343
the	8343
sons	8343
of	8344
autolycus	8344
among	8344
whom	8344
was	8344
ulysses	8344
close	8344
behind	8344
the	8344
dogs	8344
and	8344
he	8344
had	8345
a	8345
long	8345
spear	8345
in	8345
his	8345
hand	8345
here	8345
was	8345
the	8345
lair	8345
of	8345
a	8345
huge	8345
boar	8345
among	8345
some	8346
thick	8346
brushwood	8346
so	8346
dense	8346
that	8346
the	8346
wind	8346
and	8346
rain	8346
could	8346
not	8346
get	8346
through	8347
it	8347
nor	8347
could	8347
the	8347
sun's	8347
rays	8347
pierce	8347
it	8347
and	8347
the	8347
ground	8347
underneath	8347
lay	8348
thick	8348
with	8348
fallen	8348
leaves	8348
the	8348
boar	8348
heard	8348
the	8348
noise	8348
of	8348
the	8348
men's	8348
feet	8349
and	8349
the	8349
hounds	8349
baying	8349
on	8349
every	8349
side	8349
as	8349
the	8349
huntsmen	8349
came	8349
up	8349
to	8350
him	8350
so	8350
rushed	8350
from	8350
his	8350
lair	8350
raised	8350
the	8350
bristles	8350
on	8350
his	8350
neck	8350
and	8351
stood	8351
at	8351
bay	8351
with	8351
fire	8351
flashing	8351
from	8351
his	8351
eyes	8351
ulysses	8351
was	8351
the	8351
first	8352
to	8352
raise	8352
his	8352
spear	8352
and	8352
try	8352
to	8352
drive	8352
it	8352
into	8352
the	8352
brute	8352
but	8352
the	8352
boar	8353
was	8353
too	8353
quick	8353
for	8353
him	8353
and	8353
charged	8353
him	8353
sideways	8353
ripping	8353
him	8353
above	8354
the	8354
knee	8354
with	8354
a	8354
gash	8354
that	8354
tore	8354
deep	8354
though	8354
it	8354
did	8354
not	8354
reach	8354
the	8355
bone	8355
as	8355
for	8355
the	8355
boar	8355
ulysses	8355
hit	8355
him	8355
on	8355
the	8355
right	8355
shoulder	8355
and	8356
the	8356
point	8356
of	8356
the	8356
spear	8356
went	8356
right	8356
through	8356
him	8356
so	8356
that	8356
he	8356
fell	8356
groaning	8357
in	8357
the	8357
dust	8357
until	8357
the	8357
life	8357
went	8357
out	8357
of	8357
him	8357
the	8357
sons	8357
of	8357
autolycus	8357
busied	8358
themselves	8358
with	8358
the	8358
carcass	8358
of	8358
the	8358
boar	8358
and	8358
bound	8358
ulysses	8358
wound	8359
then	8359
after	8359
saying	8359
a	8359
spell	8359
to	8359
stop	8359
the	8359
bleeding	8359
they	8359
went	8359
home	8360
as	8360
fast	8360
as	8360
they	8360
could	8360
but	8360
when	8360
autolycus	8360
and	8360
his	8360
sons	8360
had	8360
thoroughly	8360
healed	8361
ulysses	8361
they	8361
made	8361
him	8361
some	8361
splendid	8361
presents	8361
and	8361
sent	8361
him	8361
back	8362
to	8362
ithaca	8362
with	8362
much	8362
mutual	8362
good	8362
will	8362
when	8362
he	8362
got	8362
back	8362
his	8362
father	8362
and	8363
mother	8363
were	8363
rejoiced	8363
to	8363
see	8363
him	8363
and	8363
asked	8363
him	8363
all	8363
about	8363
it	8363
and	8363
how	8364
he	8364
had	8364
hurt	8364
himself	8364
to	8364
get	8364
the	8364
scar	8364
so	8364
he	8364
told	8364
them	8364
how	8364
the	8364
boar	8364
had	8365
ripped	8365
him	8365
when	8365
he	8365
was	8365
out	8365
hunting	8365
with	8365
autolycus	8365
and	8365
his	8365
sons	8365
on	8366
mount	8366
parnassus	8366
as	8368
soon	8368
as	8368
euryclea	8368
had	8368
got	8368
the	8368
scarred	8368
limb	8368
in	8368
her	8368
hands	8368
and	8368
had	8368
well	8369
hold	8369
of	8369
it	8369
she	8369
recognized	8369
it	8369
and	8369
dropped	8369
the	8369
foot	8369
at	8369
once	8369
the	8369
leg	8370
fell	8370
into	8370
the	8370
bath	8370
which	8370
rang	8370
out	8370
and	8370
was	8370
overturned	8370
so	8370
that	8370
all	8371
the	8371
water	8371
was	8371
spilt	8371
on	8371
the	8371
ground	8371
euryclea's	8371
eyes	8371
between	8371
her	8371
joy	8372
and	8372
her	8372
grief	8372
filled	8372
with	8372
tears	8372
and	8372
she	8372
could	8372
not	8372
speak	8372
but	8372
she	8373
caught	8373
ulysses	8373
by	8373
the	8373
beard	8373
and	8373
said	8373
my	8373
dear	8373
child	8373
i	8373
am	8373
sure	8373
you	8374
must	8374
be	8374
ulysses	8374
himself	8374
only	8374
i	8374
did	8374
not	8374
know	8374
you	8374
till	8374
i	8374
had	8374
actually	8374
touched	8375
and	8375
handled	8375
you	8375
as	8377
she	8377
spoke	8377
she	8377
looked	8377
towards	8377
penelope	8377
as	8377
though	8377
wanting	8377
to	8377
tell	8377
her	8378
that	8378
her	8378
dear	8378
husband	8378
was	8378
in	8378
the	8378
house	8378
but	8378
penelope	8378
was	8378
unable	8378
to	8379
look	8379
in	8379
that	8379
direction	8379
and	8379
observe	8379
what	8379
was	8379
going	8379
on	8379
for	8379
minerva	8379
had	8380
diverted	8380
her	8380
attention	8380
so	8380
ulysses	8380
caught	8380
euryclea	8380
by	8380
the	8380
throat	8380
with	8381
his	8381
right	8381
hand	8381
and	8381
with	8381
his	8381
left	8381
drew	8381
her	8381
close	8381
to	8381
him	8381
and	8381
said	8381
nurse	8382
do	8382
you	8382
wish	8382
to	8382
be	8382
the	8382
ruin	8382
of	8382
me	8382
you	8382
who	8382
nursed	8382
me	8382
at	8382
your	8382
own	8383
breast	8383
now	8383
that	8383
after	8383
twenty	8383
years	8383
of	8383
wandering	8383
i	8383
am	8383

been	8384
borne	8384
in	8384

the	8414
most	8414
incessant	8414

cruel	8415

the	8420
greatness	8420

out	8421
of	8421

the	8421
memory	8421
of	8421
my	8421

whether	8422
it	8422
is	8422
not	8422
now	8422
time	8422
for	8422
me	8422
to	8422
go	8422
with	8422
the	8422
best	8422
of	8422
these	8422
suitors	8423
who	8423
are	8423
wooing	8423
me	8423
and	8423
making	8423
me	8423
such	8423
magnificent	8423
presents	8423
as	8424
long	8424
as	8424
my	8424
son	8424
was	8424
still	8424
young	8424
and	8424
unable	8424
to	8424
understand	8424
he	8424
would	8424
not	8425
hear	8425
of	8425
my	8425
leaving	8425
my	8425
husband's	8425
house	8425
but	8425
now	8425
that	8425
he	8425
is	8425
full	8425
grown	8426
he	8426
begs	8426
and	8426
prays	8426
me	8426
to	8426
do	8426
so	8426
being	8426
incensed	8426
at	8426
the	8426
way	8426
in	8426
which	8427
the	8427
suitors	8427
are	8427
eating	8427
up	8427
his	8427
property	8427
listen	8427
then	8427
to	8427
a	8427
dream	8427
that	8428
i	8428
have	8428
had	8428
and	8428
interpret	8428
it	8428
for	8428
me	8428
if	8428
you	8428
can	8428
i	8428
have	8428
twenty	8428
geese	8429
about	8429
the	8429
house	8429
that	8429
eat	8429
mash	8429
out	8429
of	8429
a	8429
trough	8429
and	8429
of	8429
which	8429
i	8430
am	8430
exceedingly	8430
fond	8430
i	8430
dreamed	8430
that	8430
a	8430
great	8430
eagle	8430
came	8430
swooping	8430
down	8431
from	8431
a	8431
mountain	8431
and	8431
dug	8431
his	8431
curved	8431
beak	8431
into	8431
the	8431
neck	8431
of	8431
each	8431
of	8432
them	8432
till	8432
he	8432
had	8432
killed	8432
them	8432
all	8432
presently	8432
he	8432
soared	8432
off	8432
into	8432
the	8433
sky	8433
and	8433
left	8433
them	8433
lying	8433
dead	8433
about	8433
the	8433
yard	8433
whereon	8433
i	8433
wept	8433
in	8433
my	8434
room	8434
till	8434
all	8434
my	8434
maids	8434
gathered	8434
round	8434
me	8434
so	8434
piteously	8434
was	8434
i	8434
grieving	8434
because	8435
the	8435
eagle	8435
had	8435
killed	8435
my	8435
geese	8435
then	8435
he	8435
came	8435
back	8435
again	8435
and	8435
perching	8436
on	8436
a	8436
projecting	8436
rafter	8436
spoke	8436
to	8436
me	8436
with	8436
human	8436
voice	8436
and	8436
told	8437
me	8437
to	8437
leave	8437
off	8437
crying	8437
be	8437
of	8437
good	8437
courage	8437

said	8437
daughter	8437
of	8438
icarius	8438
this	8438
is	8438
no	8438
dream	8438
but	8438
a	8438
vision	8438
of	8438
good	8438
omen	8438
that	8438
shall	8438
surely	8439
come	8439
to	8439
pass	8439
the	8439
geese	8439
are	8439
the	8439
suitors	8439
and	8439
i	8439
am	8439
no	8439
longer	8439

who	8440
am	8440
come	8440
back	8440
to	8440
you	8440
and	8440
who	8440
will	8440
bring	8441
these	8441
suitors	8441
to	8441
a	8441
disgraceful	8441
end	8441
on	8441
this	8441
i	8441
woke	8441
and	8441
when	8441
i	8442
looked	8442
out	8442
i	8442
saw	8442
my	8442
geese	8442
at	8442
the	8442
trough	8442
eating	8442
their	8442
mash	8442

be	8445
fulfilled	8445
the	8445
death	8446
of	8446
the	8446

portended	8446
and	8446
not	8446
one	8446

very	8449
curious	8449

invariably	8450
come	8450
true	8450
there	8450

two	8451

through	8451
which	8451
these	8451
unsubstantial	8451
fancies	8451

through	8452
the	8452

those	8453
from	8453
the	8453

something	8453
to	8454

them	8454
i	8454

through	8455
the	8455

on	8488
the	8489

of	8489
the	8489

ulysses	8491
lay	8491
wakefully	8491
brooding	8491
upon	8491
the	8491
way	8491

which	8492
he	8492
should	8492
kill	8492
the	8492

by	8492

by	8492
the	8492
women	8492
who	8492
had	8492
been	8493
in	8493
the	8493
habit	8493

misconducting	8493
themselves	8493

laughing	8494
with	8494
one	8494
another	8494
this	8494
made	8494
ulysses	8494
very	8494
angry	8495
and	8495
he	8495
doubted	8495
whether	8495
to	8495
get	8495
up	8495
and	8495
kill	8495
every	8495
single	8495
one	8495
of	8496
them	8496
then	8496
and	8496
there	8496
or	8496
to	8496
let	8496
them	8496
sleep	8496
one	8496
more	8496
and	8496
last	8496
time	8496
with	8497
the	8497
suitors	8497
his	8497
heart	8497
growled	8497
within	8497
him	8497
and	8497
as	8497
a	8497
bitch	8497
with	8497
puppies	8498
growls	8498
and	8498
shows	8498
her	8498
teeth	8498
when	8498
she	8498
sees	8498
a	8498
stranger	8498
so	8498
did	8498
his	8499
heart	8499
growl	8499
with	8499
anger	8499
at	8499
the	8499
evil	8499
deeds	8499
that	8499
were	8499
being	8499
done	8499
but	8500
he	8500
beat	8500
his	8500
breast	8500
and	8500
said	8500
heart	8500
be	8500
still	8500
you	8500
had	8500
worse	8500
than	8500
this	8501
to	8501
bear	8501
on	8501
the	8501
day	8501
when	8501
the	8501
terrible	8501
cyclops	8501
ate	8501
your	8501
brave	8501
companions	8501
yet	8502
you	8502
bore	8502
it	8502
in	8502
silence	8502
till	8502
your	8502
cunning	8502
got	8502
you	8502
safe	8502
out	8502
of	8502
the	8502
cave	8503
though	8503
you	8503
made	8503
sure	8503
of	8503
being	8503
killed	8503
thus	8505
he	8505
chided	8505
with	8505
his	8505
heart	8505
and	8505
checked	8505
it	8505
into	8505
endurance	8505
but	8505
he	8506
tossed	8506
about	8506
as	8506
one	8506
who	8506
turns	8506
a	8506
paunch	8506
full	8506
of	8506
blood	8506
and	8506
fat	8506
in	8506
front	8507
of	8507
a	8507
hot	8507
fire	8507
doing	8507
it	8507
first	8507
on	8507
one	8507
side	8507
and	8507
then	8507
on	8507
the	8507
other	8507
that	8508
he	8508
may	8508
get	8508
it	8508
cooked	8508
as	8508
soon	8508
as	8508
possible	8508
even	8508
so	8508
did	8508
he	8508
turn	8508
himself	8509
about	8509
from	8509
side	8509
to	8509
side	8509
thinking	8509
all	8509
the	8509
time	8509
how	8509
single	8509
handed	8510
as	8510
he	8510
was	8510
he	8510
should	8510
contrive	8510
to	8510
kill	8510
so	8510
large	8510
a	8510
body	8510
of	8510
men	8510
as	8511
the	8511
wicked	8511
suitors	8511
but	8511
by	8511
and	8511
by	8511
minerva	8511
came	8511
down	8511
from	8511
heaven	8511
in	8512
the	8512
likeness	8512
of	8512
a	8512
woman	8512
and	8512
hovered	8512
over	8512
his	8512
head	8512
saying	8512
my	8512
poor	8513
unhappy	8513
man	8513
why	8513
do	8513
you	8513
lie	8513
awake	8513
in	8513
this	8513
way	8513
this	8513
is	8513
your	8513
house	8513
your	8514
wife	8514
is	8514
safe	8514
inside	8514
it	8514
and	8514
so	8514
is	8514
your	8514
son	8514
who	8514
is	8514
just	8514
such	8514
a	8514
young	8515
man	8515
as	8515
any	8515
father	8515
may	8515
be	8515
proud	8515
of	8515
goddess	8517
answered	8517
ulysses	8517
all	8517
that	8517
you	8517
have	8517
said	8517
is	8517
true	8517
but	8517
i	8518
am	8518
in	8518
some	8518
doubt	8518
as	8518
to	8518
how	8518
i	8518
shall	8518
be	8518
able	8518
to	8518
kill	8518
these	8518
wicked	8518
suitors	8519
single	8519
handed	8519
seeing	8519
what	8519
a	8519
number	8519
of	8519
them	8519
there	8519
always	8519
are	8519
and	8520
there	8520
is	8520
this	8520
further	8520
difficulty	8520
which	8520
is	8520
still	8520
more	8520
considerable	8520
supposing	8521
that	8521
with	8521
jove's	8521
and	8521
your	8521
assistance	8521
i	8521
succeed	8521
in	8521
killing	8521
them	8522
i	8522
must	8522
ask	8522
you	8522
to	8522
consider	8522
where	8522
i	8522
am	8522
to	8522
escape	8522
to	8522
from	8522
their	8522
avengers	8523
when	8523
it	8523
is	8523
all	8523
over	8523
for	8525
shame	8525
replied	8525
minerva	8525
why	8525
any	8525
one	8525
else	8525
would	8525
trust	8525
a	8525
worse	8525
ally	8526
than	8526
myself	8526
even	8526
though	8526
that	8526
ally	8526
were	8526
only	8526
a	8526
mortal	8526
and	8526
less	8526
wise	8527
than	8527
i	8527
am	8527
am	8527
i	8527
not	8527
a	8527
goddess	8527

have	8527
i	8527
not	8527
protected	8527
you	8527
throughout	8527
in	8528
all	8528
your	8528
troubles	8528
i	8528
tell	8528
you	8528
plainly	8528
that	8528
even	8528
though	8528
there	8528
were	8528
fifty	8529
bands	8529
of	8529
men	8529
surrounding	8529
us	8529
and	8529
eager	8529
to	8529
kill	8529
us	8529
you	8529
should	8529
take	8530
all	8530
their	8530
sheep	8530
and	8530
cattle	8530
and	8530
drive	8530
them	8530
away	8530
with	8530
you	8530
but	8530
go	8531
to	8531
sleep	8531
it	8531
is	8531
a	8531
very	8531
bad	8531
thing	8531
to	8531
lie	8531
awake	8531
all	8531
night	8531
and	8531
you	8531
shall	8532
be	8532
out	8532
of	8532
your	8532
troubles	8532

she	8534
shed	8534
sleep	8534
over	8534
his	8534
eyes	8534
and	8534
then	8534
went	8534
back	8534
to	8534
olympus	8534
while	8536
ulysses	8536
was	8536
thus	8536
yielding	8536
himself	8536
to	8536
a	8536
very	8536
deep	8536
slumber	8536
that	8536
eased	8537
the	8537
burden	8537
of	8537
his	8537
sorrows	8537
his	8537
admirable	8537
wife	8537
awoke	8537
and	8537
sitting	8537
up	8538
in	8538
her	8538
bed	8538
began	8538
to	8538
cry	8538
when	8538
she	8538
had	8538
relieved	8538
herself	8538
by	8538
weeping	8538
she	8539
prayed	8539
to	8539
diana	8539

an	8540
arrow	8540
into	8540
my	8540
heart	8540
and	8540
slay	8540
me	8540
or	8540
let	8540
some	8540
whirlwind	8540
snatch	8540
me	8541
up	8541
and	8541
bear	8541
me	8541
through	8541
paths	8541
of	8541
darkness	8541
till	8541
it	8541
drop	8541
me	8541
into	8541
the	8541
mouths	8542
of	8542
overflowing	8542
oceanus	8542
as	8542
it	8542
did	8542
the	8542
daughters	8542
of	8542
pandareus	8542
the	8543
daughters	8543
of	8543
pandareus	8543
lost	8543
their	8543
father	8543
and	8543
mother	8543
for	8543
the	8543
gods	8543
killed	8544
them	8544
so	8544
they	8544
were	8544
left	8544
orphans	8544
but	8544
venus	8544
took	8544
care	8544
of	8544
them	8544
and	8545
fed	8545
them	8545
on	8545
cheese	8545
honey	8545
and	8545
sweet	8545
wine	8545
juno	8545
taught	8545
them	8545
to	8545
excel	8546
all	8546
women	8546
in	8546
beauty	8546
of	8546
form	8546
and	8546
understanding	8546
diana	8546
gave	8546
them	8546
an	8547
imposing	8547
presence	8547
and	8547
minerva	8547
endowed	8547
them	8547
with	8547
every	8547
kind	8547
of	8547
accomplishment	8548
but	8548
one	8548
day	8548
when	8548
venus	8548
had	8548
gone	8548
up	8548
to	8548
olympus	8548
to	8548
see	8548
jove	8549
about	8549
getting	8549
them	8549
married	8549
for	8549
well	8549
does	8549
he	8549
know	8549
both	8549
what	8549
shall	8549
happen	8550
and	8550
what	8550
not	8550
happen	8550
to	8550
every	8550
one	8550
the	8550
storm	8550
winds	8550
came	8550
and	8550
spirited	8551
them	8551
away	8551
to	8551
become	8551
handmaids	8551
to	8551
the	8551
dread	8551
erinyes	8551
even	8551
so	8552
i	8552
wish	8552
that	8552
the	8552
gods	8552
who	8552
live	8552
in	8552
heaven	8552
would	8552
hide	8552
me	8552
from	8552
mortal	8552
sight	8553
or	8553
that	8553
fair	8553
diana	8553
might	8553
strike	8553
me	8553
for	8553
i	8553
would	8553
fain	8553
go	8553
even	8553
beneath	8554
the	8554
sad	8554
earth	8554
if	8554
i	8554
might	8554
do	8554
so	8554
still	8554
looking	8554
towards	8554
ulysses	8554
only	8555
and	8555
without	8555
having	8555
to	8555
yield	8555
myself	8555
to	8555
a	8555
worse	8555
man	8555
than	8555
he	8555
was	8555
besides	8556
no	8556
matter	8556
how	8556
much	8556
people	8556
may	8556
grieve	8556
by	8556
day	8556
they	8556
can	8556
put	8556
up	8557
with	8557
it	8557
so	8557
long	8557
as	8557
they	8557
can	8557
sleep	8557
at	8557
night	8557
for	8557
when	8557
the	8557
eyes	8557
are	8557
closed	8558
in	8558
slumber	8558
people	8558
forget	8558
good	8558
and	8558
ill	8558
alike	8558
whereas	8558
my	8558
misery	8558
haunts	8559
me	8559
even	8559
in	8559
my	8559
dreams	8559
this	8559
very	8559
night	8559
methought	8559
there	8559
was	8559
one	8559
lying	8560
by	8560
my	8560
side	8560
who	8560
was	8560
like	8560
ulysses	8560
as	8560
he	8560
was	8560
when	8560
he	8560
went	8560
away	8560
with	8561
his	8561
host	8561
and	8561
i	8561
rejoiced	8561
for	8561
i	8561
believed	8561
that	8561
it	8561
was	8561
no	8561
dream	8561
but	8562
the	8562
very	8562
truth	8562
itself	8562
on	8564
this	8564
the	8564
day	8564
broke	8564
but	8564
ulysses	8564
heard	8564
the	8564
sound	8564
of	8564
her	8564
weeping	8564
and	8565
it	8565
puzzled	8565
him	8565
for	8565
it	8565
seemed	8565
as	8565
though	8565
she	8565
already	8565
knew	8565
him	8565
and	8565
was	8566
by	8566
his	8566
side	8566
then	8566
he	8566
gathered	8566
up	8566
the	8566
cloak	8566
and	8566
the	8566
fleeces	8566
on	8566
which	8567
he	8567
had	8567
lain	8567
and	8567
set	8567
them	8567
on	8567
a	8567
seat	8567
in	8567
the	8567
cloister	8567
but	8567
he	8567
took	8568
the	8568
bullock's	8568
hide	8568
out	8568
into	8568
the	8568
open	8568
he	8568
lifted	8568
up	8568
his	8568
hands	8568
to	8569
heaven	8569
and	8569
prayed	8569
saying	8569
father	8569
jove	8569
since	8569
you	8569
have	8569
seen	8569
fit	8569
to	8570
bring	8570
me	8570
over	8570
land	8570
and	8570
sea	8570
to	8570
my	8570
own	8570
home	8570
after	8570
all	8570
the	8570
afflictions	8570
you	8571
have	8571
laid	8571
upon	8571
me	8571
give	8571
me	8571
a	8571
sign	8571
out	8571
of	8571
the	8571
mouth	8571
of	8571
some	8571
one	8571
or	8572
other	8572
of	8572
those	8572
who	8572
are	8572
now	8572
waking	8572
within	8572
the	8572
house	8572
and	8572
let	8572
me	8572
have	8573
another	8573
sign	8573
of	8573
some	8573
kind	8573
from	8573
outside	8573
thus	8575
did	8575
he	8575
pray	8575
jove	8575
heard	8575
his	8575
prayer	8575
and	8575
forthwith	8575
thundered	8575
high	8575
up	8576
among	8576
the	8576
from	8576
the	8576
splendour	8576
of	8576
olympus	8576
and	8576
ulysses	8576
was	8576
glad	8576
when	8576
he	8577
heard	8577
it	8577
at	8577
the	8577
same	8577
time	8577
within	8577
the	8577
house	8577
a	8577
miller-woman	8577
from	8577
hard	8578
by	8578
in	8578
the	8578
mill	8578
room	8578
lifted	8578
up	8578
her	8578
voice	8578
and	8578
gave	8578
him	8578
another	8578
sign	8579
there	8579
were	8579
twelve	8579
miller-women	8579
whose	8579
business	8579
it	8579
was	8579
to	8579
grind	8579
wheat	8580
and	8580
barley	8580
which	8580
are	8580
the	8580
staff	8580
of	8580
life	8580
the	8580
others	8580
had	8580
ground	8580
their	8581
task	8581
and	8581
had	8581
gone	8581
to	8581
take	8581
their	8581
rest	8581
but	8581
this	8581
one	8581
had	8581
not	8581
yet	8581
finished	8582
for	8582
she	8582
was	8582
not	8582
so	8582
strong	8582
as	8582
they	8582
were	8582
and	8582
when	8582
she	8582
heard	8582
the	8583
thunder	8583
she	8583
stopped	8583
grinding	8583
and	8583
gave	8583
the	8583
sign	8583
to	8583
her	8583
master	8583
father	8584
jove	8584
said	8584
she	8584
you	8584
who	8584
rule	8584
over	8584
heaven	8584
and	8584
earth	8584
you	8584
have	8585
thundered	8585
from	8585
a	8585
clear	8585
sky	8585
without	8585
so	8585
much	8585
as	8585
a	8585
cloud	8585
in	8585
it	8585
and	8586
this	8586
means	8586
something	8586
for	8586
somebody	8586
grant	8586
the	8586
prayer	8586
then	8586
of	8586
me	8587
your	8587
poor	8587
servant	8587
who	8587
calls	8587
upon	8587
you	8587
and	8587
let	8587
this	8587
be	8587
the	8587
very	8587
last	8588
day	8588
that	8588
the	8588
suitors	8588

in	8588
the	8588
house	8588
of	8588
ulysses	8588
they	8588
have	8588
worn	8589
me	8589
out	8589
with	8589
the	8589
labour	8589
of	8589
grinding	8589
meal	8589
for	8589
them	8589
and	8589
i	8589
hope	8589
they	8590
may	8590
never	8590
have	8590
another	8590
dinner	8590
anywhere	8590
at	8590
all	8590
ulysses	8592
was	8592
glad	8592
when	8592
he	8592
heard	8592
the	8592
omens	8592
conveyed	8592
to	8592
him	8592
by	8592
the	8592
woman's	8592
speech	8593
and	8593
by	8593
the	8593
thunder	8593
for	8593
he	8593
knew	8593
they	8593
meant	8593
that	8593
he	8593
should	8593
avenge	8594
himself	8594
on	8594
the	8594
suitors	8594
then	8596
the	8596
other	8596

in	8596
the	8596
house	8596

fire	8596
on	8596
the	8596
hearth	8596
telemachus	8597
also	8597
rose	8597
and	8597
put	8597
on	8597
his	8597
clothes	8597
he	8597
girded	8597
his	8597
sword	8597
about	8597
his	8598
shoulder	8598
bound	8598
his	8598
sandals	8598
on	8598
his	8598
comely	8598
feet	8598
and	8598
took	8598
a	8598
doughty	8598
spear	8599
with	8599
a	8599
point	8599
of	8599
sharpened	8599
bronze	8599
then	8599
he	8599
went	8599
to	8599
the	8599
threshold	8599
of	8600
the	8600
cloister	8600
and	8600

himself	8602
for	8602
my	8602
mother	8602
good	8602
woman	8602
though	8602
she	8602
is	8602

a	8602
way	8602
of	8602
paying	8603
great	8603
attention	8603
to	8603
second-rate	8603
people	8603
and	8603
of	8603
neglecting	8603
others	8603
who	8604

much	8604
better	8604
men	8604

liked	8608
your	8608

he	8610
said	8610
he	8610
was	8610
re	8610
such	8610
wretched	8610
outcast	8610

he	8611

him	8613
myself	8613
then	8615

went	8615
out	8615
of	8615
the	8615
court	8615
to	8615
the	8615

high-handedly	8635
in	8635

house	8635
without	8635
any	8635

been	8655
some	8655
great	8656
man	8656
but	8656
the	8656
gods	8656
give	8656
sorrow	8656
to	8656
whom	8656
they	8656
will	8656
even	8656
to	8656
kings	8656
if	8657
it	8657
so	8657
pleases	8657
them	8657
as	8659
he	8659
spoke	8659
he	8659
went	8659
up	8659
to	8659
ulysses	8659
and	8659
saluted	8659
him	8659
with	8659
his	8659
right	8659
hand	8659
good	8660
day	8660
to	8660
you	8660
father	8660
stranger	8660
said	8660
he	8660
you	8660
seem	8660
to	8660
be	8660
very	8660
poorly	8661
off	8661
now	8661
but	8661
i	8661
hope	8661
you	8661
will	8661
have	8661
better	8661
times	8661
by	8661
and	8661
by	8661
father	8661
jove	8662
of	8662
all	8662
gods	8662
you	8662
are	8662
the	8662
most	8662
malicious	8662
we	8662
are	8662
your	8662
own	8662
children	8662
yet	8663
you	8663
show	8663
us	8663
no	8663
mercy	8663
in	8663
all	8663
our	8663
misery	8663
and	8663
afflictions	8663
a	8663
sweat	8663
came	8664
over	8664
me	8664
when	8664
i	8664
saw	8664
this	8664
man	8664
and	8664
my	8664
eyes	8664
filled	8664
with	8664
tears	8664
for	8664
he	8665
reminds	8665
me	8665
of	8665
ulysses	8665
who	8665
i	8665
fear	8665
is	8665
going	8665
about	8665
in	8665
just	8665
such	8665
rags	8665
as	8666
this	8666
man's	8666
are	8666
if	8666
indeed	8666
he	8666
is	8666
still	8666
among	8666
the	8666
living	8666
if	8666
he	8666
is	8666
already	8667
dead	8667
and	8667
in	8667
the	8667
house	8667
of	8667
hades	8667
then	8667
alas	8667
for	8667
my	8667
good	8667
master	8667
who	8668
made	8668
me	8668
his	8668
stockman	8668
when	8668
i	8668
was	8668
quite	8668
young	8668
among	8668
the	8668
cephallenians	8668
and	8669
now	8669
his	8669
cattle	8669
are	8669
countless	8669
no	8669
one	8669
could	8669
have	8669
done	8669
better	8669
with	8669
them	8670
than	8670
i	8670
have	8670
for	8670
they	8670
have	8670
bred	8670
like	8670
ears	8670
of	8670
corn	8670
nevertheless	8670
i	8671
have	8671
to	8671
keep	8671
bringing	8671
them	8671
in	8671
for	8671
others	8671
to	8671
eat	8671
who	8671
take	8671
no	8671
heed	8671
of	8672
his	8672
son	8672
though	8672
he	8672
is	8672
in	8672
the	8672
house	8672
and	8672
fear	8672
not	8672
the	8672
wrath	8672
of	8672
heaven	8672
but	8673
are	8673
already	8673
eager	8673
to	8673
divide	8673
ulysses	8673
property	8673
among	8673
them	8673
because	8673
he	8674
has	8674
been	8674
away	8674
so	8674
long	8674
i	8674
have	8674
often	8674
thought	8674
only	8674
it	8674
would	8674
not	8674
be	8675
right	8675
while	8675
his	8675
son	8675
is	8675
living	8675
of	8675
going	8675
off	8675
with	8675
the	8675
cattle	8675
to	8675
some	8676
foreign	8676
country	8676
bad	8676
as	8676
this	8676
would	8676
be	8676
it	8676
is	8676
still	8676
harder	8676
to	8676
stay	8677
here	8677
and	8677
be	8677
ill-treated	8677
about	8677
other	8677
people's	8677
herds	8677
my	8677
position	8677
is	8678
intolerable	8678
and	8678
i	8678
should	8678
long	8678
since	8678
have	8678
run	8678
away	8678
and	8678
put	8678
myself	8678
under	8679
the	8679
protection	8679
of	8679
some	8679
other	8679
chief	8679
only	8679
that	8679
i	8679
believe	8679
my	8679
poor	8679
master	8680
will	8680
yet	8680
return	8680
and	8680
send	8680
all	8680
these	8680
suitors	8680
flying	8680
out	8680
of	8680
the	8680
house	8681
stockman	8683
answered	8683
ulysses	8683
you	8683
seem	8683
to	8683
be	8683
a	8683
very	8683
well-disposed	8683
person	8684
and	8684
i	8684
can	8684
see	8684
that	8684
you	8684
are	8684
a	8684
man	8684
of	8684
sense	8684
therefore	8684
i	8684
will	8684
tell	8685
you	8685
and	8685
will	8685
confirm	8685
my	8685
words	8685
with	8685
an	8685
oath	8685
by	8685
jove	8685
the	8685
chief	8685
of	8686
all	8686
gods	8686
and	8686
by	8686
that	8686
hearth	8686
of	8686
ulysses	8686
to	8686
which	8686
i	8686
am	8686
now	8686
come	8686
ulysses	8687
shall	8687
return	8687
before	8687
you	8687
leave	8687
this	8687
place	8687
and	8687
if	8687
you	8687
are	8687
so	8687
minded	8688
you	8688
shall	8688
see	8688
him	8688
killing	8688
the	8688
suitors	8688
who	8688
are	8688
now	8688
masters	8688
here	8688
if	8690
jove	8690
were	8690
to	8690
bring	8690
this	8690
to	8690
pass	8690
replied	8690
the	8690
stockman	8690
you	8690
should	8690
see	8691
how	8691
i	8691
would	8691
do	8691
my	8691
very	8691
utmost	8691
to	8691
help	8691
him	8691
and	8693
in	8693
like	8693
manner	8693
eumaeus	8693
prayed	8693
that	8693
ulysses	8693
might	8693
return	8693
home	8693
thus	8695
did	8695
they	8695
converse	8695
meanwhile	8695
the	8695
suitors	8695
were	8695
hatching	8695
a	8695
plot	8695
to	8696
murder	8696
telemachus	8696
but	8696
a	8696
bird	8696
flew	8696
near	8696
them	8696
on	8696
their	8696
left	8696
hand	8696
an	8697
eagle	8697
with	8697
a	8697
dove	8697
in	8697
its	8697
talons	8697
on	8697
this	8697
amphinomus	8697
said	8697
my	8697
friends	8697
this	8698
plot	8698
of	8698
ours	8698
to	8698
murder	8698
telemachus	8698
will	8698
not	8698
succeed	8698
let	8698
us	8698
go	8698
to	8699
dinner	8699
instead	8699
the	8701
others	8701
assented	8701
so	8701
they	8701
went	8701
inside	8701
and	8701
laid	8701
their	8701
cloaks	8701
on	8701
the	8702
benches	8702
and	8702
seats	8702
they	8702
sacrificed	8702
the	8702
sheep	8702
goats	8702
pigs	8702
and	8702
the	8703
heifer	8703
and	8703
when	8703
the	8703
inward	8703
meats	8703
were	8703
cooked	8703
they	8703
served	8703
them	8703
round	8704
they	8704
mixed	8704
the	8704
wine	8704
in	8704
the	8704
mixing-bowls	8704
and	8704
the	8704
swineherd	8704
gave	8705
every	8705
man	8705
his	8705
cup	8705
while	8705
philoetius	8705
handed	8705
round	8705
the	8705
bread	8705
in	8705
the	8706
breadbaskets	8706
and	8706
melanthius	8706
poured	8706
them	8706
out	8706
their	8706
wine	8706
then	8706
they	8707
laid	8707
their	8707
hands	8707
upon	8707
the	8707
good	8707
things	8707
that	8707
were	8707
before	8707
them	8707
telemachus	8709
purposely	8709
made	8709
ulysses	8709
sit	8709
in	8709
the	8709
part	8709
of	8709
the	8709
cloister	8709
that	8710
was	8710
paved	8710
with	8710
stone	8710
he	8710
gave	8710
him	8710
a	8710
shabby-looking	8710
seat	8710
at	8710
a	8710
little	8711
table	8711
to	8711
himself	8711
and	8711
had	8711
his	8711
portion	8711
of	8711
the	8711
inward	8711
meats	8711
brought	8711
to	8712
him	8712
with	8712
his	8712
wine	8712
in	8712
a	8712
gold	8712
cup	8712
sit	8712
there	8712
said	8712
he	8712
and	8712
drink	8712
your	8713
wine	8713
among	8713
the	8713
great	8713
people	8713
i	8713
will	8713
put	8713
a	8713
stop	8713
to	8713
the	8713
gibes	8713
and	8713
blows	8714
of	8714
the	8714
suitors	8714
for	8714
this	8714
is	8714
no	8714
public	8714
house	8714
but	8714
belongs	8714
to	8714
ulysses	8715
and	8715
has	8715
passed	8715
from	8715
him	8715
to	8715
me	8715
therefore	8715
suitors	8715
keep	8715
your	8715
hands	8716
and	8716
your	8716
tongues	8716
to	8716
yourselves	8716
or	8716
there	8716
will	8716
be	8716
mischief	8716
the	8718
suitors	8718
bit	8718
their	8718
lips	8718
and	8718
marvelled	8718
at	8718
the	8718
boldness	8718
of	8718
his	8718
speech	8718
then	8719
antinous	8719
said	8719
we	8719
do	8719
not	8719
like	8719
such	8719
language	8719
but	8719
we	8719
will	8719
put	8719
up	8720
with	8720
it	8720
for	8720
telemachus	8720
is	8720
threatening	8720
us	8720
in	8720
good	8720
earnest	8720
if	8720
jove	8720
had	8721
let	8721
us	8721
we	8721
should	8721
have	8721
put	8721
a	8721
stop	8721
to	8721
his	8721
brave	8721
talk	8721
ere	8721
now	8721
thus	8723
spoke	8723
antinous	8723
but	8723
telemachus	8723
heeded	8723
him	8723
not	8723
meanwhile	8723
the	8723
heralds	8724
were	8724
bringing	8724
the	8724
holy	8724
hecatomb	8724
through	8724
the	8724
city	8724
and	8724
the	8724
achaeans	8725
gathered	8725
under	8725
the	8725
shady	8725
grove	8725
of	8725
apollo	8725
then	8727
they	8727
roasted	8727
the	8727
outer	8727
meat	8727
drew	8727
it	8727
off	8727
the	8727
spits	8727
gave	8727
every	8727
man	8728
his	8728
portion	8728
and	8728
feasted	8728
to	8728
their	8728
hearts	8728
content	8728
those	8728
who	8728
waited	8728
at	8729
table	8729
gave	8729
ulysses	8729
exactly	8729
the	8729
same	8729
portion	8729
as	8729
the	8729
others	8729
had	8729
for	8730
telemachus	8730
had	8730
told	8730
them	8730
to	8730
do	8730
so	8730
but	8732
minerva	8732
would	8732
not	8732
let	8732
the	8732
suitors	8732
for	8732
one	8732
moment	8732
drop	8732
their	8732
insolence	8732
for	8733
she	8733
wanted	8733
ulysses	8733
to	8733
become	8733
still	8733
more	8733
bitter	8733
against	8733
them	8733
now	8733
there	8734
happened	8734
to	8734
be	8734
among	8734
them	8734
a	8734
ribald	8734
fellow	8734
whose	8734
name	8734
was	8734
ctesippus	8734
and	8735
who	8735
came	8735
from	8735
same	8735
this	8735
man	8735
confident	8735
in	8735
his	8735
great	8735
wealth	8735
was	8735
paying	8736
court	8736
to	8736
the	8736
wife	8736
of	8736
ulysses	8736
and	8736
said	8736
to	8736
the	8736
suitors	8736
hear	8736
what	8737
i	8737
have	8737
to	8737
say	8737
the	8737
stranger	8737
has	8737
already	8737
had	8737
as	8737
large	8737
a	8737
portion	8737
as	8738
any	8738
one	8738
else	8738
this	8738
is	8738
well	8738
for	8738
it	8738
is	8738
not	8738
right	8738
nor	8738
reasonable	8738
to	8739
ill-treat	8739
any	8739
guest	8739
of	8739
telemachus	8739
who	8739
comes	8739
here	8739
i	8739
will	8739
however	8739
make	8740
him	8740
a	8740
present	8740
on	8740
my	8740
own	8740
account	8740
that	8740
he	8740
may	8740
have	8740
something	8740
to	8740
give	8741
to	8741
the	8741
bath-woman	8741
or	8741
to	8741
some	8741
other	8741
of	8741
ulysses	8741
servants	8741
as	8743
he	8743
spoke	8743
he	8743
picked	8743
up	8743
a	8743
heifer's	8743
foot	8743
from	8743
the	8743
meat-basket	8743
in	8743
which	8743
it	8744
lay	8744
and	8744
threw	8744
it	8744
at	8744
ulysses	8744
but	8744
ulysses	8744
turned	8744
his	8744
head	8744
a	8744
little	8744
aside	8745
and	8745
avoided	8745
it	8745
smiling	8745
grimly	8745
sardinian	8745
fashion	8745
as	8745
he	8745
did	8745
so	8746
and	8746
it	8746
hit	8746
the	8746
wall	8746
not	8746
him	8746
on	8746
this	8746
telemachus	8746
spoke	8746
fiercely	8746
to	8747
ctesippus	8747
it	8747
is	8747
a	8747
good	8747
thing	8747
for	8747
you	8747
said	8747
he	8747
that	8747
the	8747
stranger	8747
turned	8748
his	8748
head	8748
so	8748
that	8748
you	8748
missed	8748
him	8748
if	8748
you	8748
had	8748
hit	8748
him	8748
i	8748
should	8748
have	8749
run	8749
you	8749
through	8749
with	8749
my	8749
spear	8749
and	8749
your	8749
father	8749
would	8749
have	8749
had	8749
to	8750
see	8750
about	8750
getting	8750
you	8750
buried	8750
rather	8750
than	8750
married	8750
in	8750
this	8750
house	8750
so	8751
let	8751
me	8751
have	8751
no	8751
more	8751
unseemly	8751
behaviour	8751
from	8751
any	8751
of	8751
you	8751
for	8751
i	8751
am	8751
grown	8752
up	8752
now	8752
to	8752
the	8752
knowledge	8752
of	8752
good	8752
and	8752
evil	8752
and	8752
understand	8752
what	8752
is	8753
going	8753
on	8753
instead	8753
of	8753
being	8753
the	8753
child	8753
that	8753
i	8753
have	8753
been	8753
heretofore	8753
i	8754
have	8754
long	8754
seen	8754
you	8754
killing	8754
my	8754
sheep	8754
and	8754
making	8754
free	8754
with	8754
my	8754
corn	8754
and	8755
wine	8755
i	8755
have	8755
put	8755
up	8755
with	8755
this	8755
for	8755
one	8755
man	8755
is	8755
no	8755
match	8755
for	8755
many	8755
but	8756
do	8756
me	8756
no	8756
further	8756
violence	8756
still	8756
if	8756
you	8756
wish	8756
to	8756
kill	8756
me	8756
kill	8756
me	8757
i	8757
would	8757
far	8757
rather	8757
die	8757
than	8757
see	8757
such	8757
disgraceful	8757
scenes	8757
day	8757
after	8757
day	8758
guests	8758

men	8758
dragging	8758
the	8758
women	8758
servants	8758
about	8758
the	8758
house	8759
in	8759
an	8759
unseemly	8759
way	8759
they	8761
all	8761
held	8761
their	8761
peace	8761
till	8761
at	8761
last	8761
agelaus	8761
son	8761
of	8761
damastor	8761
said	8761
no	8762
one	8762
should	8762
take	8762
offence	8762
at	8762
what	8762
has	8762
just	8762
been	8762
said	8762
nor	8762
gainsay	8762
it	8763
for	8763
it	8763
is	8763
quite	8763
reasonable	8763
leave	8763
off	8763
therefore	8763
ill-treating	8763
the	8764
stranger	8764
or	8764
any	8764
one	8764
else	8764
of	8764
the	8764
servants	8764
who	8764
are	8764
about	8764
the	8764
house	8764
i	8765
would	8765
say	8765
however	8765
a	8765
friendly	8765
word	8765
to	8765
telemachus	8765
and	8765
his	8765
mother	8765
which	8766
i	8766
trust	8766
may	8766
commend	8766
itself	8766
to	8766
both	8766
as	8766
long	8766
i	8766
would	8766
say	8766
as	8767
you	8767
had	8767
ground	8767
for	8767
hoping	8767
that	8767
ulysses	8767
would	8767
one	8767
day	8767
come	8767
home	8767
no	8768
one	8768
could	8768
complain	8768
of	8768
your	8768
waiting	8768
and	8768
suffering	8768
the	8768
suitors	8768
to	8768
be	8769
in	8769
your	8769
house	8769
it	8769
would	8769
have	8769
been	8769
better	8769
that	8769
he	8769
should	8769
have	8769
returned	8769
but	8770
it	8770
is	8770
now	8770
sufficiently	8770
clear	8770
that	8770
he	8770
will	8770
never	8770
do	8770
so	8770
therefore	8770
talk	8771
all	8771
this	8771
quietly	8771
over	8771
with	8771
your	8771
mother	8771
and	8771
tell	8771
her	8771
to	8771
marry	8771
the	8772
best	8772
man	8772
and	8772
the	8772
one	8772
who	8772
makes	8772
her	8772
the	8772
most	8772
advantageous	8772
offer	8772
thus	8773
you	8773
will	8773
yourself	8773
be	8773
able	8773
to	8773
manage	8773
your	8773
own	8773
inheritance	8773
and	8773
to	8774
eat	8774
and	8774
drink	8774
in	8774
peace	8774
while	8774
your	8774
mother	8774
will	8774
look	8774
after	8774
some	8774
other	8775

the	8785

immoderately	8785
and	8785
set	8785
their	8786

what	8789

it	8789
that	8789

left	8808
the	8808

went	8808
back	8808
to	8808
piraeus	8808
who	8808
gave	8808
him	8808

the	8809

you	8811

this	8812
importunate	8812

telemachus	8818
gave	8818
him	8818
no	8818
heed	8818
but	8818
sat	8818
silently	8818
watching	8818
his	8818
father	8818
expecting	8819
every	8819
moment	8819
that	8819

would	8819
begin	8819
his	8819
attack	8819
upon	8819

her	8822
facing	8822
the	8822

cloisters	8822
so	8822
that	8822
she	8822
could	8822
hear	8823
what	8823
every	8823
one	8823
was	8823
saying	8823
the	8823
dinner	8823
indeed	8823

been	8823
prepared	8823
amid	8824

the	8825

nothing	8825

be	8825
conceived	8825
more	8826
gruesome	8826
than	8826
the	8826

a	8826
goddess	8826
and	8826
a	8826

a	8846
long	8846
journey	8846

quite	8846
young	8846
for	8847
his	8847
father	8847
and	8847
the	8847
other	8847

also	8848
to	8848
try	8848
and	8848
get	8848
back	8848
twelve	8848
brood	8848
mares	8849
that	8849
he	8849

that	8849
were	8849
running	8849
with	8849
them	8850
these	8850
mares	8850
were	8850
the	8850
death	8850
of	8850
him	8850
in	8850
the	8850
end	8850
for	8850
when	8850
he	8850
went	8850
to	8851
the	8851
house	8851
of	8851
jove's	8851
son	8851
mighty	8851
hercules	8851
who	8851
performed	8851
such	8851
prodigies	8851
of	8852
valour	8852
hercules	8852
to	8852
his	8852
shame	8852
killed	8852
him	8852
though	8852
he	8852
was	8852
his	8852
guest	8852
for	8853
he	8853
feared	8853
not	8853
heaven's	8853
vengeance	8853
nor	8853
yet	8853
respected	8853
his	8853
own	8853
table	8853
which	8854
he	8854
had	8854
set	8854
before	8854
iphitus	8854
but	8854
killed	8854
him	8854
in	8854
spite	8854
of	8854
everything	8854
and	8855
kept	8855
the	8855
mares	8855
himself	8855
it	8855
was	8855
when	8855
claiming	8855
these	8855
that	8855
iphitus	8855
met	8856
ulysses	8856
and	8856
gave	8856
him	8856
the	8856
bow	8856
which	8856
mighty	8856
eurytus	8856
had	8856
been	8856
used	8856
to	8857
carry	8857
and	8857
which	8857
on	8857
his	8857
death	8857
had	8857
been	8857
left	8857
by	8857
him	8857
to	8857
his	8857
son	8857
ulysses	8858
gave	8858
him	8858
in	8858
return	8858
a	8858
sword	8858
and	8858
a	8858
spear	8858
and	8858
this	8858
was	8858
the	8858
beginning	8858
of	8859
a	8859
fast	8859
friendship	8859
although	8859
they	8859
never	8859
visited	8859
at	8859
one	8859
another's	8859
houses	8860
for	8860
jove's	8860
son	8860
hercules	8860
killed	8860
iphitus	8860
ere	8860
they	8860
could	8860
do	8860
so	8860
this	8861
bow	8861
then	8861
given	8861
him	8861
by	8861
iphitus	8861
had	8861
not	8861
been	8861
taken	8861
with	8861
him	8861
by	8862
ulysses	8862
when	8862
he	8862
sailed	8862
for	8862
troy	8862
he	8862
had	8862
used	8862
it	8862
so	8862
long	8862
as	8862
he	8862
had	8862
been	8863
at	8863
home	8863
but	8863
had	8863
left	8863
it	8863
behind	8863
as	8863
having	8863
been	8863
a	8863
keepsake	8863
from	8863
a	8864
valued	8864
friend	8864
penelope	8866
presently	8866
reached	8866
the	8866
oak	8866
threshold	8866
of	8866
the	8866
store	8866
room	8866
the	8866
carpenter	8867
had	8867
planed	8867
this	8867
duly	8867
and	8867
had	8867
drawn	8867
a	8867
line	8867
on	8867
it	8867
so	8867
as	8867
to	8867
get	8868
it	8868
quite	8868
straight	8868
he	8868
had	8868
then	8868
set	8868
the	8868
door	8868
posts	8868
into	8868
it	8868
and	8868
hung	8869
the	8869
doors	8869
she	8869
loosed	8869
the	8869
strap	8869
from	8869
the	8869
handle	8869
of	8869
the	8869
door	8869
put	8870
in	8870
the	8870
key	8870
and	8870
drove	8870
it	8870
straight	8870
home	8870
to	8870
shoot	8870
back	8870
the	8870
bolts	8870
that	8871
held	8871
the	8871
doors	8871
these	8871
flew	8871
open	8871
with	8871
a	8871
noise	8871
like	8871
a	8871
bull	8871
bellowing	8871
in	8872
a	8872
meadow	8872
and	8872
penelope	8872
stepped	8872
upon	8872
the	8872
raised	8872
platform	8872
where	8872
the	8873
chests	8873
stood	8873
in	8873
which	8873
the	8873
fair	8873
linen	8873
and	8873
clothes	8873
were	8873
laid	8873
by	8873
along	8874
with	8874
fragrant	8874
herbs	8874
reaching	8874
thence	8874
she	8874
took	8874
down	8874
the	8874
bow	8874
with	8875
its	8875
bow	8875
case	8875
from	8875
the	8875
peg	8875
on	8875
which	8875
it	8875
hung	8875
she	8875
sat	8875
down	8875
with	8875
it	8876
on	8876
her	8876
knees	8876
weeping	8876
bitterly	8876
as	8876
she	8876
took	8876
the	8876
bow	8876
out	8876
of	8876
its	8876
case	8876
and	8877
when	8877
her	8877
tears	8877
had	8877
relieved	8877
her	8877
she	8877
went	8877
to	8877
the	8877
cloister	8877
where	8877
the	8878
suitors	8878
were	8878
carrying	8878
the	8878
bow	8878
and	8878
the	8878
quiver	8878
with	8878
the	8878
many	8878
deadly	8878
arrows	8879
that	8879
were	8879
inside	8879
it	8879
along	8879
with	8879
her	8879
came	8879
her	8879
maidens	8879
bearing	8879
a	8880
chest	8880
that	8880
contained	8880
much	8880
iron	8880
and	8880
bronze	8880
which	8880
her	8880
husband	8880
had	8880
won	8881
as	8881
prizes	8881
when	8881
she	8881
reached	8881
the	8881
suitors	8881
she	8881
stood	8881
by	8881
one	8881
of	8881
the	8881
bearing-posts	8882
supporting	8882
the	8882
roof	8882
of	8882
the	8882

holding	8882
a	8882
veil	8882
before	8883
her	8883

and	8883
with	8883
a	8883
maid	8883
on	8883
either	8883
side	8883
of	8883
her	8883
then	8883
she	8883
said	8883
listen	8885
to	8885
me	8885
you	8885
suitors	8885
who	8885
persist	8885
in	8885
abusing	8885
the	8885
hospitality	8885
of	8886
this	8886
house	8886
because	8886
its	8886
owner	8886
has	8886
been	8886
long	8886
absent	8886
and	8886
without	8886
other	8887
pretext	8887
than	8887
that	8887
you	8887
want	8887
to	8887
marry	8887
me	8887
this	8887
then	8887
being	8887
the	8887
prize	8888
that	8888
you	8888
are	8888
contending	8888
for	8888
i	8888
will	8888
bring	8888
out	8888
the	8888
mighty	8888
bow	8888
of	8889
ulysses	8889
and	8889
whomsoever	8889
of	8889
you	8889
shall	8889
string	8889
it	8889
most	8889
easily	8889
and	8889
send	8890
his	8890
arrow	8890
through	8890
each	8890
one	8890
of	8890
twelve	8890
axes	8890
him	8890

i	8890
follow	8890
and	8891
quit	8891
this	8891
house	8891
of	8891
my	8891
lawful	8891
husband	8891
so	8891
goodly	8891
and	8891
so	8891
abounding	8891
in	8892
wealth	8892
but	8892
even	8892
so	8892
i	8892
doubt	8892
not	8892
that	8892
i	8892
shall	8892
remember	8892
it	8892
in	8892
my	8892
dreams	8893
as	8895
she	8895
spoke	8895
she	8895
told	8895
eumaeus	8895
to	8895
set	8895
the	8895
bow	8895
and	8895
the	8895
pieces	8895
of	8895
iron	8895
before	8896
the	8896
suitors	8896
and	8896
eumaeus	8896
wept	8896
as	8896
he	8896
took	8896
them	8896
to	8896
do	8896
as	8896
she	8896
had	8897
bidden	8897
him	8897
hard	8897
by	8897
the	8897
stockman	8897
wept	8897
also	8897
when	8897
he	8897
saw	8897
his	8897
master's	8897
bow	8898
but	8898
antinous	8898
scolded	8898
them	8898
you	8898
country	8898
louts	8898
said	8898
he	8898
silly	8898
simpletons	8899
why	8899
should	8899
you	8899
add	8899
to	8899
the	8899
sorrows	8899
of	8899
your	8899
mistress	8899
by	8899
crying	8900
in	8900
this	8900
way	8900
she	8900
has	8900
enough	8900
to	8900
grieve	8900
her	8900
in	8900
the	8900
loss	8900
of	8900
her	8900
husband	8901
sit	8901

therefore	8901
and	8901
eat	8901
your	8901
dinners	8901
in	8901
silence	8901
or	8901
go	8902
outside	8902
if	8902
you	8902
want	8902
to	8902
cry	8902
and	8902
leave	8902
the	8902
bow	8902
behind	8902
you	8902
we	8902
suitors	8902
shall	8903
have	8903
to	8903
contend	8903
for	8903
it	8903
with	8903
might	8903
and	8903
main	8903
for	8903
we	8903
shall	8903
find	8903
it	8904
no	8904
light	8904
matter	8904
to	8904
string	8904
such	8904
a	8904
bow	8904
as	8904
this	8904
is	8904
there	8904
is	8904
not	8904
a	8904
man	8905
of	8905
us	8905
all	8905
who	8905
is	8905
such	8905

seen	8905
him	8905
and	8906
remember	8906
him	8906
though	8906
i	8906
was	8906
then	8906
only	8906
a	8906
child	8906
this	8908
was	8908
what	8908
he	8908
said	8908
but	8908
all	8908
the	8908
time	8908
he	8908
was	8908
expecting	8908
to	8908
be	8908
able	8908
to	8909
string	8909
the	8909
bow	8909
and	8909
shoot	8909
through	8909
the	8909
iron	8909
whereas	8909
in	8909
fact	8909
he	8909
was	8909
to	8910
be	8910
the	8910
first	8910
that	8910

taste	8910
of	8910
the	8910
arrows	8910
from	8910
the	8910
hands	8910
of	8910
ulysses	8911

egging	8911
the	8911
others	8911
on	8912
to	8912
do	8912
so	8912
also	8912
then	8914
telemachus	8914

heavens	8914
he	8914
exclaimed	8914
jove	8914

sword	8929
from	8929
his	8929
shoulder	8929
first	8929
he	8929
set	8929
the	8929
axes	8929
in	8929
a	8930
row	8930
in	8930
a	8930
long	8930
groove	8930
which	8930
he	8930
had	8930
dug	8930
for	8930
them	8930
and	8930
had	8930
wade	8930
straight	8930
by	8931
line	8931
then	8931
he	8931
stamped	8931
the	8931
earth	8931
tight	8931
round	8931
them	8931
and	8931
everyone	8931
was	8932
surprised	8932
when	8932
they	8932
saw	8932
him	8932
set	8932
up	8932
so	8932
orderly	8932
though	8932
he	8932
had	8932
never	8932
seen	8933
anything	8933
of	8933
the	8933
kind	8933
before	8933
this	8933
done	8933
he	8933
went	8933
on	8933
to	8933
the	8933
pavement	8933
to	8934
make	8934
trial	8934
of	8934
the	8934
bow	8934
thrice	8934
did	8934
he	8934
tug	8934
at	8934
it	8934
trying	8934
with	8934
all	8934
his	8935
might	8935
to	8935
draw	8935
the	8935
string	8935
and	8935
thrice	8935
he	8935
had	8935
to	8935
leave	8935
off	8935
though	8935
he	8936
had	8936
hoped	8936
to	8936
string	8936
the	8936
bow	8936
and	8936
shoot	8936
through	8936
the	8936
iron	8936
he	8936
was	8936
trying	8937
for	8937
the	8937
fourth	8937
time	8937
and	8937
would	8937
have	8937
strung	8937
it	8937
had	8937
not	8937
ulysses	8937
made	8938
a	8938
sign	8938
to	8938
check	8938
him	8938
in	8938
spite	8938
of	8938
all	8938
his	8938
eagerness	8938
so	8938
he	8938
said	8938
alas	8940
i	8940
shall	8940
either	8940
be	8940
always	8940
feeble	8940
and	8940
of	8940
no	8940
prowess	8940
or	8940
i	8940
am	8940
too	8941
young	8941
and	8941
have	8941
not	8941
yet	8941
reached	8941
my	8941
full	8941
strength	8941
so	8941
as	8941
to	8941
be	8941
able	8941
to	8942
hold	8942
my	8942
own	8942
if	8942
any	8942
one	8942
attacks	8942
me	8942
you	8942
others	8942
therefore	8942
who	8942
are	8942
stronger	8943
than	8943
i	8943
make	8943
trial	8943
of	8943
the	8943
bow	8943
and	8943
get	8943
this	8943
contest	8943
settled	8943
on	8945
this	8945
he	8945
put	8945
the	8945
bow	8945
down	8945
letting	8945
it	8945
lean	8945
against	8945
the	8945
door	8945
that	8945
led	8946
into	8946
the	8946
house	8946
with	8946
the	8946
arrow	8946
standing	8946
against	8946
the	8946
top	8946
of	8946
the	8946
bow	8947
then	8947
he	8947
sat	8947
down	8947
on	8947
the	8947
seat	8947
from	8947
which	8947
he	8947
had	8947
risen	8947
and	8947
antinous	8947
said	8948
come	8950
on	8950
each	8950
of	8950
you	8950
in	8950
his	8950
turn	8950
going	8950
towards	8950
the	8950
right	8950
from	8950
the	8950
place	8951
at	8951
which	8951
the	8951
cupbearer	8951
begins	8951
when	8951
he	8951
is	8951
handing	8951
round	8951
the	8951
wine	8952
the	8954
rest	8954
agreed	8954
and	8954
leiodes	8954
son	8954
of	8954
oenops	8954
was	8954
the	8954
first	8954
to	8954
rise	8954
he	8955
was	8955
sacrificial	8955
priest	8955
to	8955
the	8955
suitors	8955
and	8955
sat	8955
in	8955
the	8955
corner	8955
near	8955
the	8956
mixing-bowl	8956
he	8956
was	8956
the	8956
only	8956
man	8956
who	8956
hated	8956
their	8956
evil	8956
deeds	8956
and	8956
was	8957
indignant	8957
with	8957
the	8957
others	8957
he	8957
was	8957
now	8957
the	8957
first	8957
to	8957
take	8957
the	8957
bow	8957
and	8958
arrow	8958
so	8958
he	8958
went	8958
on	8958
to	8958
the	8958
pavement	8958
to	8958
make	8958
his	8958
trial	8958
but	8958
he	8958
could	8959
not	8959
string	8959
the	8959
bow	8959
for	8959
his	8959
hands	8959
were	8959
weak	8959
and	8959
unused	8959
to	8959
hard	8959
work	8960
they	8960
therefore	8960
soon	8960
grew	8960
tired	8960
and	8960
he	8960
said	8960
to	8960
the	8960
suitors	8960
my	8961
friends	8961
i	8961
cannot	8961
string	8961
it	8961
let	8961
another	8961
have	8961
it	8961
this	8961
bow	8961
shall	8961
take	8962
the	8962
life	8962
and	8962
soul	8962
out	8962
of	8962
many	8962
a	8962
chief	8962
among	8962
us	8962
for	8962
it	8962
is	8962
better	8962
to	8963
die	8963
than	8963
to	8963
live	8963
after	8963
having	8963
missed	8963
the	8963
prize	8963
that	8963
we	8963
have	8963
so	8963
long	8964
striven	8964
for	8964
and	8964
which	8964
has	8964
brought	8964
us	8964
so	8964
long	8964
together	8964
some	8964
one	8965
of	8965
us	8965
is	8965
even	8965
now	8965
hoping	8965
and	8965
praying	8965
that	8965
he	8965
may	8965
marry	8965
penelope	8965
but	8966
when	8966
he	8966
has	8966
seen	8966
this	8966
bow	8966
and	8966
tried	8966
it	8966
let	8966
him	8966
woo	8966
and	8966
make	8966
bridal	8966
offerings	8967
to	8967
some	8967
other	8967
woman	8967
and	8967
let	8967
penelope	8967
marry	8967
whoever	8967
makes	8967
her	8968
the	8968
best	8968
offer	8968
and	8968
whose	8968
lot	8968
it	8968
is	8968
to	8968
win	8968
her	8968
on	8970
this	8970
he	8970
put	8970
the	8970
bow	8970
down	8970
letting	8970
it	8970
lean	8970
against	8970
the	8970
door	8970
with	8970
the	8971
arrow	8971
standing	8971
against	8971
the	8971
tip	8971
of	8971
the	8971
bow	8971
then	8971
he	8971
took	8971
his	8971
seat	8971
again	8972
on	8972
the	8972
seat	8972
from	8972
which	8972
he	8972
had	8972
risen	8972
and	8972
antinous	8972
rebuked	8972
him	8972
saying	8973
leiodes	8975
what	8975
are	8975
you	8975
talking	8975
about	8975
your	8975
words	8975
are	8975
monstrous	8975
and	8975
intolerable	8976
it	8976
makes	8976
me	8976
angry	8976
to	8976
listen	8976
to	8976
you	8976
shall	8976
then	8976
this	8976
bow	8977
take	8977
the	8977
life	8977
of	8977
many	8977
a	8977
chief	8977
among	8977
us	8977
merely	8977
because	8977
you	8977
cannot	8977
bend	8978
it	8978
yourself	8978
true	8978
you	8978
were	8978
not	8978
born	8978
to	8978
be	8978
an	8978
archer	8978
but	8978
there	8978
are	8979
others	8979
who	8979
will	8979
soon	8979
string	8979
it	8979
then	8981
he	8981
said	8981
to	8981
melanthius	8981
the	8981
goatherd	8981
look	8981
sharp	8981
light	8981
a	8981
fire	8981
in	8982
the	8982
court	8982
and	8982
set	8982
a	8982
seat	8982
hard	8982
by	8982
with	8982
a	8982
sheep	8982
skin	8982
on	8982
it	8982
bring	8982
us	8983
also	8983
a	8983
large	8983
ball	8983
of	8983
lard	8983
from	8983
what	8983
they	8983
have	8983
in	8983
the	8983
house	8983
let	8983
us	8984
warm	8984
the	8984
bow	8984
and	8984
grease	8984
it	8984
we	8984
will	8984
then	8984
make	8984
trial	8984
of	8984
it	8984
again	8984
and	8985
bring	8985
the	8985
contest	8985
to	8985
an	8985
end	8985
melanthius	8987
lit	8987
the	8987
fire	8987
and	8987
set	8987
a	8987
seat	8987
covered	8987
with	8987
sheep	8987
skins	8987
beside	8987
it	8988
he	8988
also	8988
brought	8988
a	8988
great	8988
ball	8988
of	8988
lard	8988
from	8988
what	8988
they	8988
had	8988
in	8988
the	8988
house	8989
and	8989
the	8989
suitors	8989
warmed	8989
the	8989
bow	8989
and	8989
again	8989
made	8989
trial	8989
of	8989
it	8989
but	8990
they	8990
were	8990
none	8990
of	8990
them	8990
nearly	8990
strong	8990
enough	8990
to	8990
string	8990
it	8990
nevertheless	8990
there	8991
still	8991
remained	8991
antinous	8991
and	8991
eurymachus	8991
who	8991
were	8991
the	8991
ringleaders	8991
among	8992
the	8992
suitors	8992
and	8992
much	8992
the	8992
foremost	8992
among	8992
them	8992
all	8992
then	8994
the	8994
swineherd	8994
and	8994
the	8994
stockman	8994
left	8994
the	8994

the	8995
outer	8996

ulysses	8996
said	8996
to	8996
them	8996
quietly	8996
stockman	8998
and	8998
you	8998
swineherd	8998
i	8998
have	8998
something	8998
in	8998
my	8998
mind	8998
which	8998
i	8998
am	8999
in	8999
doubt	8999
whether	8999
to	8999

no	8999
but	8999
i	8999
think	8999
i	8999
will	8999
say	8999
it	8999
what	8999
manner	9000
of	9000
men	9000
would	9000
you	9000
be	9000
to	9000

the	9002
suitors	9002
or	9002
with	9002
ulysses	9002
father	9004
jove	9004
answered	9004
the	9004
stockman	9004
would	9004
indeed	9004
that	9004
you	9004
might	9004
so	9005
ordain	9005
it	9005
if	9005
some	9005

were	9005
but	9005
to	9005
bring	9005
ulysses	9005
back	9005
you	9005
should	9005
see	9006
with	9006
what	9006
might	9006
and	9006
main	9006
i	9006
would	9006
fight	9006
for	9006
him	9006
in	9008
like	9008
words	9008
eumaeus	9008
prayed	9008
to	9008
all	9008
the	9008
gods	9008
that	9008
ulysses	9008
might	9008
return	9008
when	9009
therefore	9009
he	9009
saw	9009
for	9009
certain	9009
what	9009

they	9009
were	9009
of	9009

drew	9022
his	9022
rags	9022
aside	9022
from	9022
the	9022
great	9022
scar	9022
and	9022
when	9022
they	9022
had	9023
examined	9023
it	9023
thoroughly	9023
they	9023
both	9023
of	9023
them	9023
wept	9023
about	9023
ulysses	9023
threw	9024
their	9024
arms	9024
round	9024
him	9024
and	9024
kissed	9024
his	9024
head	9024
and	9024
shoulders	9024
while	9024
ulysses	9025
kissed	9025
their	9025
hands	9025
and	9025
faces	9025
in	9025
return	9025
the	9025
sun	9025
would	9025
have	9025
gone	9026
down	9026
upon	9026
their	9026
mourning	9026
if	9026
ulysses	9026
had	9026
not	9026
checked	9026
them	9026
and	9026
said	9027
cease	9029
your	9029
weeping	9029
lest	9029
some	9029
one	9029
should	9029
come	9029
outside	9029
and	9029
see	9029
us	9029
and	9030
tell	9030
those	9030
who	9030
a	9030
are	9030
within	9030
when	9030
you	9030
go	9030
in	9030
do	9030
so	9030
separately	9030
not	9031
both	9031
together	9031
i	9031
will	9031
go	9031
first	9031
and	9031
do	9031
you	9031
follow	9031
afterwards	9031
let	9032
this	9032
moreover	9032
be	9032
the	9032
token	9032
between	9032
us	9032
the	9032
suitors	9032
will	9032
all	9032
of	9032
them	9033
try	9033
to	9033
prevent	9033
me	9033
from	9033
getting	9033
hold	9033
of	9033
the	9033
bow	9033
and	9033
quiver	9033
do	9033
you	9034
therefore	9034
eumaeus	9034
place	9034
it	9034
in	9034
my	9034
hands	9034
when	9034
you	9034
are	9034
carrying	9034
it	9035
about	9035
and	9035
tell	9035
the	9035
women	9035
to	9035
close	9035
the	9035
doors	9035
of	9035
their	9035
apartment	9035
if	9036
they	9036
hear	9036
any	9036
groaning	9036
or	9036
uproar	9036
as	9036
of	9036
men	9036
fighting	9036
about	9036
the	9036
house	9036
they	9037
must	9037
not	9037
come	9037
out	9037
they	9037
must	9037
keep	9037
quiet	9037
and	9037
stay	9037
where	9037
they	9037
are	9038
at	9038
their	9038
work	9038
and	9038
i	9038
charge	9038
you	9038
philoetius	9038
to	9038
make	9038
fast	9038
the	9038
doors	9039
of	9039
the	9039
outer	9039
court	9039
and	9039
to	9039
bind	9039
them	9039
securely	9039
at	9039
once	9039
when	9041
he	9041
had	9041
thus	9041
spoken	9041
he	9041
went	9041
back	9041
to	9041
the	9041
house	9041
and	9041
took	9041
the	9041
seat	9041
that	9042
he	9042
had	9042
left	9042
presently	9042
his	9042
two	9042
servants	9042
followed	9042
him	9042
inside	9042
at	9044
this	9044
moment	9044
the	9044
bow	9044
was	9044
in	9044
the	9044
hands	9044
of	9044
eurymachus	9044
who	9044
was	9044
warming	9044
it	9045
by	9045
the	9045
fire	9045
but	9045
even	9045
so	9045
he	9045
could	9045
not	9045
string	9045
it	9045
and	9045
he	9045
was	9045
greatly	9045
grieved	9046
he	9046
heaved	9046
a	9046
deep	9046
sigh	9046
and	9046
said	9046
i	9046
grieve	9046
for	9046
myself	9046
and	9046
for	9047
us	9047
all	9047
i	9047
grieve	9047
that	9047
i	9047
shall	9047
have	9047
to	9047
forgo	9047
the	9047
marriage	9047
but	9047
i	9048
do	9048
not	9048
care	9048
nearly	9048
so	9048
much	9048
about	9048
this	9048
for	9048
there	9048
are	9048
plenty	9048
of	9048
other	9048
women	9049
in	9049
ithaca	9049
and	9049
elsewhere	9049
what	9049
i	9049
feel	9049
most	9049
is	9049
the	9049
fact	9049
of	9049
our	9049
being	9050
so	9050
inferior	9050
to	9050
ulysses	9050
in	9050
strength	9050
that	9050
we	9050
cannot	9050
string	9050
his	9050
bow	9051
this	9051
will	9051
disgrace	9051
us	9051
in	9051
the	9051
eyes	9051
of	9051
those	9051
who	9051
are	9051
yet	9051
unborn	9051
it	9053
shall	9053
not	9053
be	9053
so	9053
eurymachus	9053
said	9053
antinous	9053
and	9053
you	9053
know	9053
it	9053
yourself	9054
to-day	9054
is	9054
the	9054
feast	9054
of	9054
apollo	9054
throughout	9054
all	9054
the	9054
land	9054
who	9054
can	9055
string	9055
a	9055
bow	9055
on	9055
such	9055
a	9055
day	9055
as	9055
this	9055
put	9055
it	9055
on	9055
one	9055
side	9055
as	9055
for	9055
the	9056
axes	9056
they	9056
can	9056
stay	9056
where	9056
they	9056
are	9056
for	9056
no	9056
one	9056
is	9056
likely	9056
to	9056
come	9056
to	9057
the	9057
house	9057
and	9057
take	9057
them	9057
away	9057
let	9057
the	9057
cupbearer	9057
go	9057
round	9057
with	9057
his	9057
cups	9058
that	9058
we	9058
may	9058
make	9058
our	9058
drink-offerings	9058
and	9058
drop	9058
this	9058
matter	9058
of	9058
the	9059
bow	9059
we	9059
will	9059
tell	9059
melanthius	9059
to	9059
bring	9059
us	9059
in	9059
some	9059
goats	9059
to-morrow	9059
the	9060
best	9060
he	9060
has	9060
we	9060
can	9060
then	9060
offer	9060
thigh	9060
bones	9060
to	9060
apollo	9060
the	9060
mighty	9060
archer	9061
and	9061
again	9061
make	9061
trial	9061
of	9061
the	9061
bow	9061
so	9061
as	9061
to	9061
bring	9061
the	9061
contest	9061
to	9062
an	9062
end	9062
the	9064
rest	9064
approved	9064
his	9064
words	9064
and	9064
thereon	9064
men	9064
servants	9064
poured	9064
water	9064
over	9065
the	9065
hands	9065
of	9065
the	9065
guests	9065
while	9065
pages	9065
filled	9065
the	9065
mixing-bowls	9065
with	9066
wine	9066
and	9066
water	9066
and	9066
handed	9066
it	9066
round	9066
after	9066
giving	9066
every	9066
man	9066
his	9066
drink-offering	9067
then	9067
when	9067
they	9067
had	9067
made	9067
their	9067
offerings	9067
and	9067
had	9067
drunk	9067
each	9068
as	9068
much	9068
as	9068
he	9068
desired	9068
ulysses	9068
craftily	9068
said	9068
suitors	9070
of	9070
the	9070
illustrious	9070
queen	9070
listen	9070
that	9070
i	9070
may	9070
speak	9070
even	9070
as	9070
i	9071
am	9071
minded	9071
i	9071
appeal	9071
more	9071
especially	9071
to	9071
eurymachus	9071
and	9071
to	9071
antinous	9071
who	9072
has	9072
just	9072
spoken	9072
with	9072
so	9072
much	9072
reason	9072
cease	9072
shooting	9072
for	9072
the	9072
present	9072
and	9073
leave	9073
the	9073
matter	9073
to	9073
the	9073
gods	9073
but	9073
in	9073
the	9073
morning	9073
let	9073
heaven	9073
give	9073
victory	9074
to	9074
whom	9074
it	9074
will	9074
for	9074
the	9074
moment	9074
however	9074
give	9074
me	9074
the	9074
bow	9074
that	9075
i	9075
may	9075
prove	9075
the	9075
power	9075
of	9075
my	9075
hands	9075
among	9075
you	9075
all	9075
and	9075
see	9075
whether	9075
i	9076
still	9076
have	9076
as	9076
much	9076
strength	9076
as	9076
i	9076
used	9076
to	9076
have	9076
or	9076
whether	9076
travel	9076
and	9077
neglect	9077
have	9077
made	9077
an	9077
end	9077
of	9077
it	9077
this	9079
made	9079
them	9079
all	9079
very	9079
angry	9079
for	9079
they	9079
feared	9079
he	9079
might	9079
string	9079
the	9079
bow	9080
antinous	9080
therefore	9080
rebuked	9080
him	9080
fiercely	9080
saying	9080
wretched	9080
creature	9080
you	9081
have	9081
not	9081
so	9081
much	9081
as	9081
a	9081
grain	9081
of	9081
sense	9081
in	9081
your	9081
whole	9081
body	9081
you	9081
ought	9081
to	9082
think	9082
yourself	9082
lucky	9082
in	9082
being	9082
allowed	9082
to	9082
dine	9082
unharmed	9082
among	9082
your	9082
betters	9083
without	9083
having	9083
any	9083
smaller	9083
portion	9083
served	9083
you	9083
than	9083
we	9083
others	9083
have	9084
had	9084
and	9084
in	9084
being	9084
allowed	9084
to	9084
hear	9084
our	9084
conversation	9084
no	9084
other	9084
beggar	9085
or	9085
stranger	9085
has	9085
been	9085
allowed	9085
to	9085
hear	9085
what	9085
we	9085
say	9085
among	9085
ourselves	9085
the	9086
wine	9086
must	9086
have	9086
been	9086
doing	9086
you	9086
a	9086
mischief	9086
as	9086
it	9086
does	9086
with	9086
all	9086
those	9087
drink	9087
immoderately	9087
it	9087
was	9087
wine	9087
that	9087
inflamed	9087
the	9087
centaur	9087
eurytion	9087
when	9088
he	9088
was	9088
staying	9088
with	9088
peirithous	9088
among	9088
the	9088
lapithae	9088
when	9088
the	9088
wine	9088
had	9089
got	9089
into	9089
his	9089
head	9089
he	9089
went	9089
mad	9089
and	9089
did	9089
ill	9089
deeds	9089
about	9089
the	9089
house	9089
of	9090
peirithous	9090
this	9090
angered	9090
the	9090
heroes	9090
who	9090
were	9090
there	9090
assembled	9090
so	9090
they	9091
rushed	9091
at	9091
him	9091
and	9091
cut	9091
off	9091
his	9091
ears	9091
and	9091
nostrils	9091
then	9091
they	9091
dragged	9091
him	9092
through	9092
the	9092
doorway	9092
out	9092
of	9092
the	9092
house	9092
so	9092
he	9092
went	9092
away	9092
crazed	9092
and	9093
bore	9093
the	9093
burden	9093
of	9093
his	9093
crime	9093
bereft	9093
of	9093
understanding	9093
henceforth	9093
therefore	9094
there	9094
was	9094
war	9094
between	9094
mankind	9094
and	9094
the	9094
centaurs	9094
but	9094
he	9094
brought	9095
it	9095
upon	9095
himself	9095
through	9095
his	9095
own	9095
drunkenness	9095
in	9095
like	9095
manner	9095
i	9096
can	9096
tell	9096
you	9096
that	9096
it	9096
will	9096
go	9096
hardly	9096
with	9096
you	9096
if	9096
you	9096
string	9096
the	9096
bow	9096
you	9097
will	9097
find	9097
no	9097
mercy	9097
from	9097
any	9097
one	9097
here	9097
for	9097
we	9097
shall	9097
at	9097
once	9097
ship	9097
you	9098
off	9098
to	9098
king	9098
echetus	9098
who	9098
kills	9098
every	9098
one	9098
that	9098
comes	9098
near	9098
him	9098
you	9099
will	9099
never	9099
get	9099
away	9099
alive	9099
so	9099
drink	9099
and	9099
keep	9099
quiet	9099
without	9099
getting	9099
into	9100
a	9100
quarrel	9100
with	9100
men	9100
younger	9100
than	9100
yourself	9100
penelope	9102
then	9102
spoke	9102
to	9102
him	9102
antinous	9102
said	9102
she	9102
it	9102
is	9102
not	9102
right	9102
that	9103
you	9103
should	9103
ill-treat	9103
any	9103
guest	9103
of	9103
telemachus	9103
who	9103
comes	9103
to	9103
this	9103
house	9104
if	9104
the	9104
stranger	9104
should	9104
prove	9104
strong	9104
enough	9104
to	9104
string	9104
the	9104
mighty	9104
bow	9105
of	9105
ulysses	9105
can	9105
you	9105
suppose	9105
that	9105
he	9105
would	9105
take	9105
me	9105
home	9105
with	9105
him	9105
and	9106
make	9106
me	9106
his	9106
wife	9106
even	9106
the	9106
man	9106
himself	9106
can	9106
have	9106
no	9106
such	9106
idea	9106
in	9106
his	9107
mind	9107
none	9107
of	9107
you	9107
need	9107
let	9107
that	9107
disturb	9107
his	9107
feasting	9107
it	9107
would	9107
be	9108
out	9108
of	9108
all	9108
reason	9108
queen	9110
penelope	9110
answered	9110
eurymachus	9110
we	9110
do	9110
not	9110
suppose	9110
that	9110
this	9110
man	9111
will	9111
take	9111
you	9111
away	9111
with	9111
him	9111
it	9111
is	9111
impossible	9111
but	9111
we	9111
are	9111
afraid	9111
lest	9112
some	9112
of	9112
the	9112
baser	9112
sort	9112

a	9113
feeble	9113

able	9115
to	9115
string	9115
and	9115
yet	9115
a	9115
beggarly	9115
tramp	9115
who	9115
came	9115
to	9115
the	9115

it	9116
at	9116

it	9117

up	9119
the	9120

a	9120
great	9120

others	9121
to	9121
think	9121
well	9121
of	9121

us	9124

no	9124

it	9124

the	9145
swineherd	9145
now	9145
took	9145
up	9145
the	9145

and	9145
was	9145
for	9145
taking	9145
it	9145
to	9145
ulysses	9145
but	9146
the	9146
suitors	9146
clamoured	9146
at	9146
him	9146
from	9146
all	9146
parts	9146
of	9146
the	9146
cloisters	9146
and	9147
one	9147
of	9147
them	9147
said	9147
you	9147
idiot	9147
where	9147
are	9147
you	9147
taking	9147
the	9147
bow	9147

you	9148
out	9148
of	9148

our	9149
prayer	9149
your	9149
own	9149
boarhounds	9149
shall	9149
get	9149
you	9149
into	9149
some	9149
quiet	9149
little	9149
place	9150
and	9150
worry	9150
you	9150
to	9150
death	9150
eumaeus	9152
was	9152
frightened	9152
at	9152
the	9152
outcry	9152
they	9152
all	9152
raised	9152
so	9152
he	9152
put	9152
the	9152
bow	9153
down	9153
then	9153
and	9153
there	9153
but	9153
telemachus	9153
shouted	9153
out	9153
at	9153
him	9153
from	9153
the	9153
other	9154
side	9154
of	9154
the	9154
cloisters	9154
and	9154
threatened	9154
him	9154
saying	9154
father	9154
eumaeus	9154
bring	9155
the	9155
bow	9155
on	9155
in	9155
spite	9155
of	9155
them	9155
or	9155
young	9155
as	9155
i	9155
am	9155
i	9155
will	9155
pelt	9155
you	9155
with	9156
stones	9156
back	9156
to	9156
the	9156
country	9156
for	9156
i	9156
am	9156
the	9156
better	9156
man	9156
of	9156
the	9156
two	9156
i	9157
wish	9157
i	9157
was	9157
as	9157
much	9157
stronger	9157
than	9157
all	9157
the	9157
other	9157
suitors	9157
in	9157
the	9157
house	9157
as	9158
i	9158
am	9158
than	9158
you	9158
i	9158
would	9158
soon	9158
send	9158
some	9158
of	9158
them	9158
off	9158
sick	9158
and	9158
sorry	9158
for	9159
they	9159
mean	9159
mischief	9159
thus	9161
did	9161
he	9161
speak	9161
and	9161
they	9161
all	9161
of	9161
them	9161
laughed	9161
heartily	9161
which	9161
put	9161
them	9162
in	9162
a	9162
better	9162
humour	9162
with	9162
telemachus	9162
so	9162
eumaeus	9162
brought	9162
the	9162
bow	9162
on	9163
and	9163
placed	9163
it	9163
in	9163
the	9163
hands	9163
of	9163
ulysses	9163
when	9163
he	9163
had	9163
done	9163
this	9163
he	9163
called	9164
euryclea	9164
apart	9164
and	9164
said	9164
to	9164
her	9164
euryclea	9164
telemachus	9164
says	9164
you	9165
are	9165
to	9165
close	9165
the	9165
doors	9165
of	9165
the	9165
women's	9165
apartments	9165
if	9165
they	9165
hear	9165
any	9166
groaning	9166
or	9166
uproar	9166
as	9166
of	9166
men	9166
fighting	9166
about	9166
the	9166
house	9166
they	9166
are	9166
not	9167
to	9167
come	9167
out	9167
but	9167
are	9167
to	9167
keep	9167
quiet	9167
and	9167
stay	9167
where	9167
they	9167
are	9167
at	9167
their	9168
work	9168
euryclea	9170
did	9170
as	9170
she	9170
was	9170
told	9170
and	9170
closed	9170
the	9170
doors	9170
of	9170
the	9170
women's	9170
apartments	9170
meanwhile	9172
philoetius	9172
slipped	9172
quietly	9172
out	9172
and	9172
made	9172
fast	9172
the	9172
gates	9172
of	9172
the	9173
outer	9173
court	9173
there	9173
was	9173
a	9173
ship's	9173
cable	9173
of	9173
byblus	9173
fibre	9173
lying	9173
in	9173
the	9174
gatehouse	9174
so	9174
he	9174
made	9174
the	9174
gates	9174
fast	9174
with	9174
it	9174
and	9174
then	9174
came	9174
in	9174
again	9175
resuming	9175
the	9175
seat	9175
that	9175
he	9175
had	9175
left	9175
and	9175
keeping	9175
an	9175
eye	9175
on	9175
ulysses	9175
who	9176
had	9176
now	9176
got	9176
the	9176
bow	9176
in	9176
his	9176
hands	9176
and	9176
was	9176
turning	9176
it	9176
every	9176
way	9176
about	9177
and	9177
proving	9177
it	9177
all	9177
over	9177
to	9177
see	9177
whether	9177
the	9177
worms	9177
had	9177
been	9177
eating	9177
into	9178
its	9178
two	9178
horns	9178
during	9178
his	9178
absence	9178
then	9178
would	9178
one	9178
turn	9178
towards	9178
his	9179
neighbour	9179
saying	9179
this	9179
is	9179
some	9179
tricky	9179
old	9179
bow-fancier	9179
either	9179
he	9180
has	9180
got	9180
one	9180
like	9180
it	9180
at	9180
home	9180
or	9180
he	9180
wants	9180
to	9180
make	9180
one	9180
in	9180
such	9180
workmanlike	9180
style	9181
does	9181
the	9181
old	9181
vagabond	9181
handle	9181
it	9181
another	9183
said	9183
i	9183
hope	9183
he	9183
may	9183
be	9183
no	9183
more	9183
successful	9183
in	9183
other	9183
things	9183
than	9184
he	9184
is	9184
likely	9184
to	9184
be	9184
in	9184
stringing	9184
this	9184
bow	9184
but	9186
ulysses	9186
when	9186
he	9186
had	9186
taken	9186
it	9186
up	9186
and	9186
examined	9186
it	9186
all	9186
over	9186
strung	9186
it	9187
as	9187
easily	9187
as	9187
a	9187
skilled	9187
bard	9187
strings	9187
a	9187
new	9187
peg	9187
of	9187
his	9187
lyre	9187
and	9187
makes	9187
the	9188
twisted	9188
gut	9188
fast	9188
at	9188
both	9188
ends	9188
then	9188
he	9188
took	9188
it	9188
in	9188
his	9188
right	9188
hand	9188
to	9189
prove	9189
the	9189
string	9189
and	9189
it	9189
sang	9189
sweetly	9189
under	9189
his	9189
touch	9189
like	9189
the	9189
twittering	9190
of	9190
a	9190
swallow	9190
the	9190
suitors	9190
were	9190
dismayed	9190
and	9190
turned	9190
colour	9190
as	9191
they	9191
heard	9191
it	9191
at	9191
that	9191
moment	9191
moreover	9191
jove	9191
thundered	9191
loudly	9191
as	9192
a	9192
sign	9192
and	9192
the	9192
heart	9192
of	9192
ulysses	9192
rejoiced	9192
as	9192
he	9192
heard	9192
the	9192
omen	9192
that	9193
the	9193
son	9193
of	9193
scheming	9193
saturn	9193
had	9193
sent	9193
him	9193
he	9195
took	9195
an	9195
arrow	9195
that	9195
was	9195
lying	9195
upon	9195
the	9195
table	9195
for	9195
those	9195
which	9195
the	9195
achaeans	9196
were	9196
so	9196
shortly	9196
about	9196
to	9196
taste	9196
were	9196
all	9196
inside	9196
the	9196
quiver	9196
he	9197
laid	9197
it	9197
on	9197
the	9197
centre-piece	9197
of	9197
the	9197
bow	9197
and	9197
drew	9197
the	9197
notch	9197
of	9197
the	9197
arrow	9198
and	9198
the	9198
string	9198
toward	9198
him	9198
still	9198
seated	9198
on	9198
his	9198
seat	9198
when	9198
he	9198
had	9199
taken	9199
aim	9199
he	9199
let	9199
fly	9199
and	9199
his	9199
arrow	9199
pierced	9199
every	9199
one	9199
of	9199
the	9199
handle-holes	9199
of	9200
the	9200
axes	9200
from	9200
the	9200
first	9200
onwards	9200
till	9200
it	9200
had	9200
gone	9200
right	9200
through	9200
them	9201
and	9201
into	9201
the	9201
outer	9201
courtyard	9201
then	9201
he	9201
said	9201
to	9201
telemachus	9201
your	9203
guest	9203
has	9203
not	9203
disgraced	9203
you	9203
telemachus	9203
i	9203
did	9203
not	9203
miss	9203
what	9203
i	9204
aimed	9204
at	9204
and	9204
i	9204
was	9204
not	9204
long	9204
in	9204
stringing	9204
my	9204
bow	9204
i	9204
am	9204
still	9204
strong	9204
and	9205
not	9205
as	9205
the	9205

me	9205

to	9207
disport	9207
themselves	9207
with	9207
song	9207

dance	9207
which	9207
are	9208
the	9208
crowning	9208
ornaments	9208
of	9208
a	9208
banquet	9208
as	9210
he	9210
spoke	9210
he	9210
made	9210
a	9210
sign	9210
with	9210
his	9210
eyebrows	9210
and	9210
telemachus	9210
girded	9210
on	9211
his	9211
sword	9211
grasped	9211
his	9211
spear	9211
and	9211
stood	9211
armed	9211
beside	9211
his	9211
father's	9211
seat	9212
book	9216
xxii	9216
then	9218
ulysses	9218
tore	9218
off	9218
his	9218
rags	9218
and	9218
sprang	9218
on	9218
to	9218
the	9218
broad	9218
pavement	9218
with	9219
his	9219
bow	9219
and	9219
his	9219
quiver	9219
full	9219
of	9219
arrows	9219
he	9219
shed	9219
the	9219
arrows	9219
on	9219
to	9220
the	9220
ground	9220
at	9220
his	9220
feet	9220
and	9220
said	9220
the	9220
mighty	9220
contest	9220
is	9220
at	9220
an	9220
end	9220
i	9221
will	9221
now	9221
see	9221
whether	9221
apollo	9221
will	9221
vouchsafe	9221
it	9221
to	9221
me	9221
to	9221
hit	9221
another	9221
mark	9222
which	9222
no	9222
man	9222
has	9222
yet	9222
hit	9222
on	9224
this	9224
he	9224
aimed	9224
a	9224
deadly	9224
arrow	9224
at	9224
antinous	9224
who	9224
was	9224
about	9224
to	9224
take	9224
up	9225
a	9225
two-handled	9225
gold	9225
cup	9225
to	9225
drink	9225
his	9225
wine	9225
and	9225
already	9225
had	9225
it	9225
in	9225
his	9226
hands	9226
he	9226
had	9226
no	9226
thought	9226
of	9226
death	9226
who	9226
amongst	9226
all	9226
the	9226
revellers	9226
would	9227
think	9227
that	9227
one	9227
man	9227
however	9227
brave	9227
would	9227
stand	9227
alone	9227
among	9227
so	9227
many	9228
and	9228
kill	9228
him	9228
the	9228
arrow	9228
struck	9228
antinous	9228
in	9228
the	9228
throat	9228
and	9228
the	9228
point	9229
went	9229
clean	9229
through	9229
his	9229
neck	9229
so	9229
that	9229
he	9229
fell	9229
over	9229
and	9229
the	9229
cup	9229
dropped	9230
from	9230
his	9230
hand	9230
while	9230
a	9230
thick	9230
stream	9230
of	9230
blood	9230
gushed	9230
from	9230
his	9230
nostrils	9231
he	9231
kicked	9231
the	9231
table	9231
from	9231
him	9231
and	9231
upset	9231
the	9231
things	9231
on	9231
it	9231
so	9232
that	9232
the	9232
bread	9232
and	9232
roasted	9232
meats	9232
were	9232
all	9232
soiled	9232
as	9232
they	9232
fell	9232
over	9232
on	9233
to	9233
the	9233
ground	9233
the	9233
suitors	9233
were	9233
in	9233
an	9233
uproar	9233
when	9233
they	9233
saw	9233
that	9233
a	9234
man	9234
had	9234
been	9234
hit	9234
they	9234
sprang	9234
in	9234
dismay	9234
one	9234
and	9234
all	9234
of	9234
them	9234
from	9234
their	9235
seats	9235
and	9235
looked	9235
everywhere	9235
towards	9235
the	9235
walls	9235
but	9235
there	9235
was	9235
neither	9236
shield	9236
nor	9236
spear	9236
and	9236
they	9236
rebuked	9236
ulysses	9236
very	9236
angrily	9236
stranger	9236
said	9237
they	9237
you	9237
shall	9237
pay	9237
for	9237
shooting	9237
people	9237
in	9237
this	9237
way	9237
om	9237
yi	9237
you	9237
shall	9238
see	9238
no	9238
other	9238
contest	9238
you	9238
are	9238
a	9238
doomed	9238
man	9238
he	9238
whom	9238
you	9238
have	9238
slain	9239
was	9239
the	9239
foremost	9239
youth	9239
in	9239
ithaca	9239
and	9239
the	9239
vultures	9239
shall	9239
devour	9239
you	9240
for	9240
having	9240
killed	9240
him	9240
thus	9242
they	9242
spoke	9242
for	9242
they	9242
thought	9242
that	9242
he	9242
had	9242
killed	9242
antinous	9242
by	9242
mistake	9242
and	9243
did	9243
not	9243
perceive	9243
that	9243
death	9243
was	9243
hanging	9243
over	9243
the	9243
head	9243
of	9243
every	9243
one	9244
of	9244
them	9244
but	9244
ulysses	9244
glared	9244
at	9244
them	9244
and	9244
said	9244
dogs	9246
did	9246
you	9246
think	9246
that	9246
i	9246
should	9246
not	9246
come	9246
back	9246
from	9246
troy	9246
you	9246
have	9246
wasted	9247
my	9247
substance	9247
have	9247
forced	9247
my	9247
women	9247
servants	9247
to	9247
lie	9247
with	9247
you	9247
and	9248
have	9248
wooed	9248
my	9248
wife	9248
while	9248
i	9248
was	9248
still	9248
living	9248
you	9248
have	9248
feared	9248
neither	9248
cod	9249
nor	9249
man	9249
and	9249
now	9249
you	9249
shall	9249
die	9249
they	9251
turned	9251
pale	9251
with	9251
fear	9251
as	9251
he	9251
spoke	9251
and	9251
every	9251
man	9251
looked	9251
round	9251
about	9252
to	9252
see	9252
whither	9252
he	9252
might	9252
fly	9252
for	9252
safety	9252
but	9252
eurymachus	9252
alone	9252
spoke	9253
if	9255
you	9255
are	9255
ulysses	9255
said	9255
he	9255
then	9255
what	9255
you	9255
have	9255
said	9255
is	9255
just	9255
we	9255
have	9256
done	9256
much	9256
wrong	9256
on	9256
your	9256
lands	9256
and	9256
in	9256
your	9256
house	9256
but	9256
antinous	9256
who	9257
was	9257
the	9257
head	9257
and	9257
front	9257
of	9257
the	9257
offending	9257
lies	9257
low	9257
already	9257
it	9257
was	9257
all	9258
his	9258
doing	9258
it	9258
was	9258
not	9258
that	9258
he	9258
wanted	9258
to	9258
marry	9258
penelope	9258
he	9258
did	9258
not	9259
so	9259
much	9259
care	9259
about	9259
that	9259
what	9259
he	9259
wanted	9259
was	9259
something	9259
quite	9259
different	9259
and	9260
jove	9260
has	9260
not	9260
vouchsafed	9260
it	9260
to	9260
him	9260
he	9260
wanted	9260
to	9260
kill	9260
your	9260
son	9260
and	9261
to	9261
be	9261
chief	9261
man	9261
in	9261

now	9261
therefore	9261
that	9261
he	9261
has	9261
met	9261
the	9261
death	9262
which	9262

till	9265
your	9265

is	9266
softened	9266
until	9266
we	9266

done	9266
this	9266
no	9266
one	9266

against	9267
us	9267
ulysses	9269
again	9269
glared	9269
at	9269
him	9269
and	9269
said	9269
though	9269
you	9269
should	9269
give	9269
me	9269
all	9269
that	9270
you	9270

or	9272
fly	9272
for	9272
your	9272

and	9272
fly	9272
not	9272
a	9272
man	9272
of	9272
you	9272
shall	9272
their	9274
hearts	9274
sank	9274
as	9274
they	9274
heard	9274
him	9274
but	9274
eurymachus	9274
again	9274
spoke	9274
saying	9274
my	9276
friends	9276
this	9276
man	9276
will	9276
give	9276
us	9276
no	9276
quarter	9276
he	9276
will	9276
stand	9276
where	9276
he	9277
is	9277
and	9277
shoot	9277
us	9277
down	9277
till	9277
he	9277
has	9277
killed	9277
every	9277
man	9277
among	9277
us	9277
let	9277
us	9278
then	9278
show	9278
fight	9278
draw	9278
your	9278
swords	9278
and	9278
hold	9278
up	9278
the	9278
tables	9278
to	9278
shield	9278
you	9279
from	9279
his	9279
arrows	9279
let	9279
us	9279
have	9279
at	9279
him	9279
with	9279
a	9279
rush	9279
to	9279
drive	9279
him	9279
from	9280
the	9280
pavement	9280
and	9280
doorway	9280
we	9280
can	9280
then	9280
get	9280
through	9280
into	9280
the	9280
town	9280
and	9281
raise	9281
such	9281
an	9281
alarm	9281
as	9281
shall	9281
soon	9281
stay	9281
his	9281
shooting	9281
as	9283
he	9283
spoke	9283
he	9283
drew	9283
his	9283
keen	9283
blade	9283
of	9283
bronze	9283
sharpened	9283
on	9283
both	9283
sides	9283
and	9284
with	9284
a	9284
loud	9284
cry	9284
sprang	9284
towards	9284
ulysses	9284
but	9284
ulysses	9284
instantly	9284
shot	9285
an	9285
arrow	9285
into	9285
his	9285
breast	9285
that	9285
caught	9285
him	9285
by	9285
the	9285
nipple	9285
and	9285
fixed	9285
itself	9286
in	9286
his	9286
liver	9286
he	9286
dropped	9286
his	9286
sword	9286
and	9286
fell	9286
doubled	9286
up	9286
over	9286
his	9287
table	9287
the	9287
cup	9287
and	9287
all	9287
the	9287
meats	9287
went	9287
over	9287
on	9287
to	9287
the	9287
ground	9287
as	9287
he	9288
smote	9288
the	9288
earth	9288
with	9288
his	9288
forehead	9288
in	9288
the	9288
agonies	9288
of	9288
death	9288
and	9288
he	9289
kicked	9289
the	9289
stool	9289
with	9289
his	9289
feet	9289
until	9289
his	9289
eyes	9289
were	9289
closed	9289
in	9289
darkness	9289
then	9291
amphinomus	9291
drew	9291
his	9291
sword	9291
and	9291
made	9291
straight	9291
at	9291
ulysses	9291
to	9291
try	9291
and	9292
get	9292
him	9292
away	9292
from	9292
the	9292
door	9292
but	9292
telemachus	9292
was	9292
too	9292
quick	9292
for	9292
him	9292
and	9293
struck	9293
him	9293
from	9293
behind	9293
the	9293
spear	9293
caught	9293
him	9293
between	9293
the	9293
shoulders	9293
and	9294
went	9294
right	9294
through	9294
his	9294
chest	9294
so	9294
that	9294
he	9294
fell	9294
heavily	9294
to	9294
the	9294
ground	9294
and	9295
struck	9295
the	9295
earth	9295
with	9295
his	9295
forehead	9295
then	9295
telemachus	9295
sprang	9295
away	9295
from	9296
him	9296
leaving	9296
his	9296
spear	9296
still	9296
in	9296
the	9296
body	9296
for	9296
he	9296
feared	9296
that	9296
if	9297
he	9297
stayed	9297
to	9297
draw	9297
it	9297
out	9297
some	9297
one	9297
of	9297
the	9297
achaeans	9297
might	9297
come	9297
up	9297
and	9298
hack	9298
at	9298
him	9298
with	9298
his	9298
sword	9298
or	9298
knock	9298
him	9298
down	9298
so	9298
he	9298
set	9298
off	9298
at	9298
a	9299
run	9299
and	9299
immediately	9299
was	9299
at	9299
his	9299
father's	9299
side	9299
then	9299
he	9299
said	9299
father	9301
let	9301
me	9301
bring	9301
you	9301
a	9301
shield	9301
two	9301
spears	9301
and	9301
a	9301
brass	9301
helmet	9301
for	9302
your	9302
temples	9302
i	9302
will	9302
arm	9302
myself	9302
as	9302
well	9302
and	9302
will	9302
bring	9302
other	9302
armour	9303
for	9303

with	9374
a	9375
painful	9375
bond	9375
as	9375
ulysses	9375

they	9375
fastened	9375
a	9375
noose	9375
about	9376

over	9377

as	9378
you	9378

the	9386
cloister	9386
fierce	9386

full	9386
of	9386
fury	9386
nevertheless	9386
those	9386

and	9405
prowess	9405
are	9405
no	9405
longer	9405
what	9406
they	9406
were	9406
when	9406
you	9406
fought	9406
for	9406
nine	9406
long	9406
years	9406
among	9406
the	9406
trojans	9406
about	9407
the	9407

you	9407
killed	9407
many	9407
a	9407
man	9407
in	9407
those	9407
days	9407
and	9407
it	9408
was	9408
through	9408
your	9408
stratagem	9408
that	9408
priam's	9408
city	9408
was	9408
taken	9408
how	9408
comes	9408
it	9409
that	9409
you	9409
are	9409
so	9409
lamentably	9409
less	9409
valiant	9409
now	9409
that	9409
you	9409
are	9409
on	9409
your	9409
own	9410
ground	9410
face	9410
to	9410

on	9411
my	9411
good	9411
fellow	9411

and	9412
requite	9412
your	9412
kindnesses	9412
conferred	9412
upon	9412
him	9412
but	9414
she	9414
would	9414
not	9414
give	9414
him	9414
full	9414
victory	9414
as	9414
yet	9414
for	9414
she	9414
wished	9414
still	9414
further	9415
to	9415
prove	9415
his	9415

the	9420
brunt	9420
of	9420
the	9420
fight	9420
upon	9421
the	9421
suitors	9421
side	9421
of	9421
all	9421
those	9421
who	9421
were	9421
still	9421
fighting	9421
for	9421
their	9421
lives	9422
they	9422
were	9422
by	9422
far	9422
the	9422
most	9422
valiant	9422
for	9422
the	9422
others	9422
had	9422
already	9422
fallen	9423
under	9423
the	9423
arrows	9423
of	9423
ulysses	9423
agelaus	9423
shouted	9423
to	9423
them	9423

my	9424
friends	9424
he	9424

not	9426

at	9426
him	9426
all	9426
at	9426
once	9426

six	9426
of	9426
you	9426
throw	9426
your	9427
spears	9427
first	9427
and	9427
see	9427
if	9427
you	9427
cannot	9427
cover	9427
yourselves	9427
with	9427
glory	9427
by	9428
killing	9428
him	9428
when	9428
he	9428
has	9428
fallen	9428
we	9428
need	9428
not	9428
be	9428
uneasy	9428
about	9428
the	9428
others	9429
they	9431
threw	9431
their	9431
spears	9431
as	9431
he	9431
bade	9431
them	9431
but	9431
minerva	9431
made	9431
them	9431
all	9431

no	9432
effect	9432
one	9432

the	9432
door	9432
the	9433
pointed	9433
shaft	9433
of	9433
another	9433
struck	9433
the	9433
wall	9433
and	9433
as	9433
soon	9433
as	9433
they	9433
had	9434
avoided	9434
all	9434
the	9434
spears	9434
of	9434
the	9434

to	9434
his	9434
own	9434
men	9435
my	9435
friends	9435
i	9435
should	9435
say	9435
we	9435
too	9435
had	9435
better	9435
let	9435
drive	9435
into	9435
the	9435
middle	9436
of	9436
them	9436
or	9436
they	9436
will	9436
crown	9436
all	9436
the	9436

have	9436
done	9436
us	9436
by	9437
us	9437
outright	9437
they	9439
therefore	9439
aimed	9439
straight	9439
in	9439
front	9439
of	9439
them	9439
and	9439
threw	9439

into	9442
a	9442
corner	9442

and	9442
his	9442
men	9442
rushed	9442
forward	9442
and	9443
regained	9443
their	9443
spears	9443
by	9443
drawing	9443
them	9443
from	9443
the	9443
bodies	9443
of	9443
the	9443
dead	9443

now	9445
aimed	9445
a	9445
second	9445
time	9445

again	9445

made	9445
their	9445

the	9446
most	9446
part	9446
without	9446
effect	9446

skin	9449
from	9449
off	9449
telemachus's	9449

to	9449
graze	9450
eumaeus's	9450
shoulder	9450
above	9450
his	9450
shield	9450
but	9450
the	9450
spear	9450
went	9450
on	9450
and	9450
fell	9451
to	9451
the	9451
ground	9451
then	9451
ulysses	9451
and	9451
his	9451

this	9453
the	9453
stockman	9453
hit	9453
ctesippus	9453
in	9453
the	9453
breast	9453
and	9453
taunted	9454
him	9454
saying	9454
foul-mouthed	9454
son	9454
of	9454
polytherses	9454

so	9454
foolish	9455
as	9455
to	9455
talk	9455
wickedly	9455
another	9455
time	9455

let	9455
heaven	9455

you	9456
a	9456
present	9456
of	9457
this	9457
advice	9457
to	9457
repay	9457
you	9457
for	9457
the	9457
foot	9457
which	9457
you	9457
gave	9457
ulysses	9457
when	9457
he	9458
was	9458
begging	9458
about	9458
in	9458
his	9458
own	9458
house	9458
thus	9460
spoke	9460
the	9460
stockman	9460
and	9460
ulysses	9460
struck	9460
the	9460
son	9460
of	9460
damastor	9460
with	9460
a	9461
spear	9461
in	9461
close	9461

leocritus	9461

in	9462
the	9462
belly	9462

the	9462
dart	9462
went	9462
clean	9462
through	9462
him	9462
so	9462
that	9462
he	9462
fell	9462
forward	9463
full	9463
on	9463
his	9463
face	9463
upon	9463

up	9464
her	9464
deadly	9464
aegis	9464
and	9464
the	9464
hearts	9464
of	9464
the	9464
suitors	9464
quailed	9465
they	9465
fled	9465
to	9465
the	9465
other	9465
end	9465
of	9465
the	9465
court	9465
like	9465
a	9465
herd	9465
of	9465
cattle	9465
maddened	9466
by	9466
the	9466
gadfly	9466
in	9466
early	9466
summer	9466
when	9466
the	9466
days	9466
are	9466
at	9466
their	9466
longest	9467
as	9467
eagle-beaked	9467
crook-taloned	9467
vultures	9467
from	9467
the	9467
mountains	9467
swoop	9468
down	9468

the	9468
smaller	9468
birds	9468
that	9468
cower	9468
in	9468
flocks	9468
upon	9468
the	9468
ground	9468
and	9469
kill	9469
them	9469
for	9469
they	9469
cannot	9469
either	9469
fight	9469
or	9469
fly	9469
and	9469
lookers	9469
on	9469
enjoy	9470
the	9470
sport	9470
even	9470
so	9470
did	9470
ulysses	9470
and	9470
his	9470
men	9470
fall	9470
upon	9470
the	9470
suitors	9470
and	9471
smite	9471
them	9471
on	9471
every	9471
side	9471
they	9471
made	9471
a	9471
horrible	9471
groaning	9471
as	9471
their	9471
brains	9472
were	9472
being	9472
battered	9472
in	9472
and	9472
the	9472
ground	9472
seethed	9472
with	9472
their	9472
blood	9472
leiodes	9474
then	9474
caught	9474
the	9474
knees	9474
of	9474
ulysses	9474
and	9474
said	9474
ulysses	9474
i	9474
beseech	9474
you	9475
have	9475
mercy	9475
upon	9475
me	9475
and	9475
spare	9475
me	9475
i	9475
never	9475
wronged	9475
any	9475
of	9475
the	9475
women	9475
in	9476
your	9476
house	9476
either	9476
in	9476
word	9476
or	9476
deed	9476
and	9476
i	9476
tried	9476
to	9476
stop	9476
the	9476
others	9476
i	9477
saw	9477
them	9477
but	9477
they	9477
would	9477
not	9477
listen	9477
and	9477
now	9477
they	9477
are	9477
paying	9477
for	9477
their	9478
folly	9478
i	9478
was	9478
their	9478
sacrificing	9478
priest	9478
if	9478
you	9478
kill	9478
me	9478
i	9478
shall	9478
die	9479
without	9479
having	9479
done	9479
anything	9479
to	9479
deserve	9479
it	9479
and	9479
shall	9479
have	9479
got	9479
no	9480
thanks	9480
for	9480
all	9480
the	9480
good	9480
that	9480
i	9480
did	9480
ulysses	9482
looked	9482
sternly	9482
at	9482
him	9482
and	9482
answered	9482
if	9482
you	9482
were	9482
their	9482
sacrificing	9482
priest	9483
you	9483
must	9483
have	9483
prayed	9483
many	9483
a	9483
time	9483
that	9483
it	9483
might	9483
be	9483
long	9483
before	9483
i	9484
got	9484
home	9484
again	9484
and	9484
that	9484
you	9484
might	9484
marry	9484
my	9484
wife	9484
and	9484
have	9484
children	9484
by	9485
her	9485
therefore	9485
you	9485
shall	9485
die	9485
with	9487
these	9487
words	9487
he	9487
picked	9487
up	9487
the	9487
sword	9487
that	9487
agelaus	9487
had	9487
dropped	9487
when	9487
he	9488
was	9488
being	9488
killed	9488
and	9488
which	9488
was	9488
lying	9488
upon	9488
the	9488

then	9488
he	9488
struck	9489
leiodes	9489
on	9489
the	9489
back	9489
of	9489
his	9489
neck	9489
so	9489
that	9489
his	9489
head	9489
fell	9489
rolling	9489
in	9490
the	9490
dust	9490
while	9490
he	9490
was	9490
yet	9490
speaking	9490
the	9492
minstrel	9492
phemius	9492
son	9492
of	9492
terpes	9492
he	9492
who	9492
had	9492
been	9492
forced	9492
by	9492
the	9492
suitors	9493
to	9493
sing	9493
to	9493
them	9493
now	9493
tried	9493
to	9493
save	9493
his	9493
life	9493
he	9493
was	9493
standing	9493
near	9494
towards	9494
the	9494
trap	9494
door	9494
and	9494
held	9494
his	9494
lyre	9494
in	9494
his	9494
hand	9494
he	9494
did	9494
not	9495
know	9495
whether	9495
to	9495
fly	9495
out	9495
of	9495
the	9495
cloister	9495
and	9495
sit	9495
down	9495
by	9495
the	9495
altar	9495
of	9496
jove	9496
that	9496
was	9496
in	9496
the	9496
outer	9496
court	9496
and	9496
on	9496
which	9496
both	9496
laertes	9496
and	9496
ulysses	9497
had	9497
offered	9497
up	9497
the	9497
thigh	9497
bones	9497
of	9497
many	9497
an	9497
ox	9497
or	9497
whether	9497
to	9497
go	9498
straight	9498
up	9498
to	9498
ulysses	9498
and	9498
embrace	9498
his	9498
knees	9498
but	9498
in	9498
the	9498
end	9498
he	9498
deemed	9499
it	9499
best	9499
to	9499
embrace	9499
ulysses	9499
knees	9499
so	9499
he	9499
laid	9499
his	9499
lyre	9499
on	9499
the	9499
ground	9500
the	9500
ground	9500
between	9500
the	9500
mixing-bowl	9500
and	9500
the	9500
silver-studded	9500
seat	9500
then	9501
going	9501
up	9501
to	9501
ulysses	9501
he	9501
caught	9501
hold	9501
of	9501
his	9501
knees	9501
and	9501
said	9501
ulysses	9501
i	9502
beseech	9502
you	9502
have	9502
mercy	9502
on	9502
me	9502
and	9502
spare	9502
me	9502
you	9502
will	9502
be	9502
sorry	9502
for	9502
it	9503
afterwards	9503
if	9503
you	9503
kill	9503
a	9503
bard	9503
who	9503
can	9503
sing	9503
both	9503
for	9503
gods	9503
and	9503
men	9503
as	9504
i	9504
can	9504
i	9504
make	9504
all	9504
my	9504
lays	9504
myself	9504
and	9504
heaven	9504
visits	9504
me	9504
with	9504
every	9504
kind	9505
of	9505
inspiration	9505
i	9505
would	9505
sing	9505
to	9505
you	9505
as	9505
though	9505
you	9505
were	9505
a	9505
god	9505
do	9506
not	9506
therefore	9506
be	9506
in	9506
such	9506
a	9506
hurry	9506
to	9506
cut	9506
my	9506
head	9506
off	9506
your	9506
own	9506
son	9506
telemachus	9507
will	9507
tell	9507
you	9507
that	9507
i	9507
did	9507
not	9507
want	9507
to	9507
frequent	9507
your	9507
house	9507
and	9508
sing	9508
to	9508
the	9508
suitors	9508
after	9508
their	9508
meals	9508
but	9508
they	9508
were	9508
too	9508
many	9508
and	9509
too	9509
strong	9509
for	9509
me	9509
so	9509
they	9509
made	9509
me	9509
telemachus	9511
heard	9511
him	9511
and	9511
at	9511
once	9511
went	9511
up	9511
to	9511
his	9511
father	9511
hold	9511
he	9511
cried	9512
the	9512
man	9512
is	9512
guiltless	9512
do	9512
him	9512
no	9512
hurt	9512
and	9512
we	9512
will	9512
medon	9512
too	9512
who	9513
was	9513
always	9513
good	9513
to	9513
me	9513
when	9513
i	9513
was	9513
a	9513
boy	9513
unless	9513
philoetius	9513
or	9513
eumaeus	9513
has	9514
already	9514
killed	9514
him	9514
or	9514
he	9514
has	9514
fallen	9514
in	9514
your	9514
way	9514
when	9514
you	9514
were	9514
raging	9515
about	9515
the	9515
court	9515
medon	9517
caught	9517
these	9517
words	9517
of	9517
telemachus	9517
for	9517
he	9517
was	9517
crouching	9517
under	9517
a	9518
seat	9518
beneath	9518
which	9518
he	9518
had	9518
hidden	9518
by	9518
covering	9518
himself	9518
up	9518
with	9518
a	9518
freshly	9518
flayed	9519
heifer's	9519
hide	9519
so	9519
he	9519
threw	9519
off	9519
the	9519
hide	9519
went	9519
up	9519
to	9519
telemachus	9519
and	9520
laid	9520
hold	9520
of	9520
his	9520
knees	9520
here	9522
i	9522
am	9522
my	9522
dear	9522
sir	9522
said	9522
he	9522
stay	9522
your	9522
hand	9522
therefore	9522
and	9522
tell	9523
your	9523
father	9523
or	9523
he	9523
will	9523
kill	9523
me	9523
in	9523
his	9523
rage	9523
against	9523
the	9523
suitors	9523
for	9524
having	9524
wasted	9524
his	9524
substance	9524
and	9524
been	9524
so	9524
foolishly	9524
disrespectful	9524
to	9525
yourself	9525
ulysses	9527
smiled	9527
at	9527
him	9527
and	9527
answered	9527
fear	9527
not	9527
telemachus	9527
has	9527
saved	9527
your	9528
life	9528
that	9528
you	9528
may	9528
know	9528
in	9528
future	9528
and	9528
tell	9528
other	9528
people	9528
how	9528
greatly	9529

good	9529
deeds	9529
prosper	9529
than	9529
evil	9529

go	9529
therefore	9529
outside	9529
the	9530
cloisters	9530
into	9530
the	9530
outer	9530
court	9530
and	9530
be	9530
out	9530
of	9530
the	9530
way	9530
of	9530
the	9530
slaughter	9530
you	9531
and	9531
the	9531
bard	9531
while	9531
i	9531
finish	9531
my	9531
work	9531
here	9531
inside	9531
the	9533
pair	9533
went	9533
into	9533
the	9533
outer	9533
court	9533
as	9533
fast	9533
as	9533
they	9533
could	9533
and	9533
sat	9533
down	9534
by	9534
jove's	9534
great	9534
altar	9534
looking	9534
fearfully	9534
round	9534
and	9534
still	9534
expecting	9534
that	9535
they	9535
would	9535
be	9535
killed	9535
then	9535
ulysses	9535
searched	9535
the	9535
whole	9535
court	9535
carefully	9535
over	9536
to	9536
see	9536
if	9536
anyone	9536
had	9536
managed	9536
to	9536
hide	9536
himself	9536
and	9536
was	9536
still	9536
living	9536
but	9537
he	9537
found	9537
them	9537
all	9537
lying	9537
in	9537
the	9537
dust	9537
and	9537
weltering	9537
in	9537
their	9537
blood	9537
they	9538
were	9538
like	9538
fishes	9538
which	9538
fishermen	9538
have	9538
netted	9538
out	9538
of	9538
the	9538
sea	9538
and	9539
thrown	9539
upon	9539
the	9539
beach	9539
to	9539
lie	9539
gasping	9539
for	9539
water	9539
till	9539
the	9539
heat	9539
of	9539
the	9540
sun	9540
makes	9540
an	9540
end	9540
of	9540
them	9540
even	9540
so	9540
were	9540
the	9540
suitors	9540
lying	9540
all	9540
huddled	9540
up	9541
one	9541
against	9541

unfastened	9550
the	9550

found	9551
ulysses	9551
among	9551
the	9551
corpses	9551
bespattered	9552
with	9552
blood	9552
and	9552
filth	9552
like	9552
a	9552

for	9599
they	9599
were	9599
insolent	9599
to	9600
me	9600
and	9600
my	9600

and	9600
used	9600
to	9600

with	9600
the	9600

so	9602
saying	9602
he	9602
made	9602
a	9602

all	9603
around	9603
the	9604
building	9604
at	9604
a	9604
good	9604
height	9604
lest	9604
any	9604
of	9604
the	9604
women's	9604
feet	9604
should	9604
touch	9605
the	9605
ground	9605
and	9605
as	9605
thrushes	9605
or	9605
doves	9605
beat	9605
against	9605
a	9605
net	9605
that	9605
has	9606
been	9606
set	9606
for	9606
them	9606
in	9606
a	9606
thicket	9606
just	9606
as	9606
they	9606
were	9606
getting	9606
to	9606
their	9606
nest	9607
and	9607
a	9607
terrible	9607
fate	9607
awaits	9607
them	9607
even	9607
so	9607
did	9607
the	9607
women	9607
have	9607
to	9608
put	9608
their	9608
heads	9608
in	9608
nooses	9608
one	9608
after	9608
the	9608

moved	9609
convulsively	9609

a	9609

what	9692
you	9692

me	9692
cannot	9692
be	9692
really	9692
true	9692
it	9692
is	9692
some	9692
god	9693
who	9693
is	9693
angry	9693
with	9693
the	9693

for	9693
their	9693
great	9693

they	9696

to	9696
a	9696

never	9697
return	9697
home	9697
again	9698
then	9700
nurse	9700
euryclea	9700
said	9700
my	9700
child	9700
what	9700
are	9700
you	9700
talking	9700
about	9700
but	9700
you	9701
were	9701
all	9701
hard	9701
of	9701
belief	9701
and	9701
have	9701
made	9701
up	9701
your	9701
mind	9701
that	9701
your	9701
husband	9701
is	9702
never	9702
coming	9702
although	9702
he	9702
is	9702
in	9702
the	9702
house	9702
and	9702
by	9702
his	9702
own	9702
fire	9702
side	9702
at	9703
this	9703
very	9703
moment	9703
besides	9703
i	9703
can	9703
give	9703
you	9703
another	9703
proof	9703
when	9703
i	9703
was	9704
washing	9704
him	9704
i	9704
perceived	9704
the	9704
scar	9704
which	9704
the	9704
wild	9704
boar	9704
gave	9704
him	9704
and	9705
i	9705
wanted	9705
to	9705
tell	9705
you	9705
about	9705
it	9705
but	9705
in	9705
his	9705
wisdom	9705
he	9705
would	9705
not	9705
let	9706
me	9706
and	9706
clapped	9706
his	9706
hands	9706
over	9706
my	9706
mouth	9706
so	9706
come	9706
with	9706
me	9706
and	9706
i	9706
will	9707
make	9707
this	9707
bargain	9707
with	9707
you	9707
if	9707
i	9707
am	9707
deceiving	9707
you	9707
you	9707
may	9707
have	9707
me	9708
killed	9708
by	9708
the	9708
most	9708
cruel	9708
death	9708
you	9708
can	9708
think	9708
of	9708
my	9710
dear	9710
nurse	9710
said	9710
penelope	9710
however	9710
wise	9710
you	9710
may	9710
be	9710
you	9710
can	9710
hardly	9710
fathom	9711
the	9711
counsels	9711
of	9711
the	9711
gods	9711
nevertheless	9711
we	9711
will	9711
go	9711
in	9711
search	9711
of	9712
my	9712
son	9712
that	9712
i	9712
may	9712
see	9712
the	9712
corpses	9712
of	9712
the	9712
suitors	9712
and	9712
the	9712
man	9712
who	9713
has	9713
killed	9713
them	9713
on	9715
this	9715
she	9715
came	9715
down	9715
from	9715
her	9715
upper	9715
room	9715
and	9715
while	9715
doing	9715
so	9715
she	9715
considered	9716
whether	9716
she	9716
should	9716
keep	9716
at	9716
a	9716
distance	9716
from	9716
her	9716
husband	9716
and	9717
question	9717
him	9717
or	9717
whether	9717
she	9717
should	9717
at	9717
once	9717
go	9717
up	9717
to	9717
him	9717
and	9717
embrace	9717
him	9718
when	9718
however	9718
she	9718
had	9718
crossed	9718
the	9718
stone	9718
floor	9718
of	9718
the	9718
cloister	9718
she	9719
sat	9719
down	9719
opposite	9719
ulysses	9719
by	9719
the	9719
fire	9719
against	9719
the	9719
wall	9719
at	9719
right	9719
angles	9720
to	9720
that	9720
by	9720
which	9720
she	9720
had	9720
entered	9720
while	9720
ulysses	9720
sat	9720
near	9720
one	9721
of	9721
the	9721
bearing-posts	9721
looking	9721
upon	9721
the	9721
ground	9721
and	9721
waiting	9721
to	9721
see	9722
what	9722
his	9722
wife	9722
would	9722
say	9722
to	9722
him	9722
when	9722
she	9722
saw	9722
him	9722
for	9722
a	9722
long	9722
time	9722
she	9723
sat	9723
silent	9723
and	9723
as	9723
one	9723
lost	9723
in	9723
amazement	9723
at	9723
one	9723
moment	9723
she	9723
looked	9723
him	9724
full	9724
in	9724
the	9724
face	9724
but	9724
then	9724
again	9724
directly	9724
she	9724
was	9724
misled	9724
by	9724
his	9724
shabby	9725
clothes	9725
and	9725
failed	9725
to	9725
recognize	9725
him	9725
till	9725
telemachus	9725
began	9725
to	9726
reproach	9726
her	9726
and	9726
said	9726
mother	9728
but	9728
you	9728
are	9728
so	9728
hard	9728
that	9728
i	9728
cannot	9728
call	9728
you	9728
by	9728
such	9728
a	9728
name	9728
why	9729
do	9729
you	9729
keep	9729
away	9729
from	9729
my	9729
father	9729
in	9729
this	9729
way	9729
why	9729
do	9729
you	9729
not	9729
sit	9729
by	9730
his	9730
side	9730
and	9730
begin	9730
talking	9730
to	9730
him	9730
and	9730
asking	9730
him	9730
questions	9730
no	9730
other	9731
woman	9731
could	9731
bear	9731
to	9731
keep	9731
away	9731
from	9731
her	9731
husband	9731
when	9731
he	9731
had	9731
come	9731
back	9732
to	9732
her	9732
after	9732
twenty	9732
years	9732
of	9732
absence	9732
and	9732
after	9732
having	9732
gone	9732
through	9732
so	9733
much	9733
but	9733
your	9733
heart	9733
always	9733
was	9733
as	9733
hard	9733
as	9733
a	9733
stone	9733
penelope	9735
answered	9735
my	9735
son	9735
i	9735
am	9735
so	9735
lost	9735
in	9735
astonishment	9735
that	9735
i	9735
can	9735
find	9736
no	9736
words	9736
in	9736
which	9736
either	9736
to	9736
ask	9736
questions	9736
or	9736
to	9736
answer	9736
them	9736
i	9737
cannot	9737
even	9737
look	9737
him	9737
straight	9737
in	9737
the	9737
face	9737
still	9737
if	9737
he	9737
really	9737
is	9737
ulysses	9738
come	9738
back	9738
to	9738
his	9738
own	9738
home	9738
again	9738
we	9738
shall	9738
get	9738
to	9738
understand	9738
one	9739
another	9739
better	9739
by	9739
and	9739
by	9739
for	9739
there	9739
are	9739
tokens	9739
with	9739
which	9739
we	9739
two	9739
are	9740
alone	9740
acquainted	9740
and	9740
which	9740
are	9740
hidden	9740
from	9740
all	9740
others	9740
ulysses	9742
smiled	9742
at	9742
this	9742
and	9742
said	9742
to	9742
telemachus	9742
let	9742
your	9742
mother	9742
put	9742
me	9743
to	9743
any	9743
proof	9743
she	9743
likes	9743
she	9743
will	9743
make	9743
up	9743
her	9743
mind	9743
about	9743
it	9743
presently	9743
she	9744
rejects	9744
me	9744
for	9744
the	9744
moment	9744
and	9744
believes	9744
me	9744
to	9744
be	9744
somebody	9744
else	9744
because	9745
i	9745
am	9745
covered	9745
with	9745
dirt	9745
and	9745
have	9745
such	9745
bad	9745
clothes	9745
on	9745
let	9745
us	9745
however	9746
consider	9746
what	9746
we	9746
had	9746
better	9746
do	9746
next	9746
when	9746
one	9746
man	9746
has	9746
killed	9746
another	9747
even	9747
though	9747
he	9747
was	9747
not	9747
one	9747

would	9747
leave	9747
many	9747
friends	9747
to	9747
take	9748
up	9748
his	9748
quarrel	9748
the	9748
man	9748
who	9748
has	9748
killed	9748
him	9748

still	9748
say	9748
good	9748
bye	9749
to	9749
his	9749
friends	9749
and	9749
fly	9749

a	9804
hard	9804
task	9804
no	9804
matter	9804
how	9804
skilled	9804

him	9805
to	9805

move	9806
it	9806
from	9806
its	9806
place	9806
for	9806
it	9806
is	9807
a	9807
marvellous	9807
curiosity	9807
which	9807
i	9807
made	9807
with	9807
my	9807
very	9807
own	9807
hands	9807
there	9807
was	9808
a	9808
young	9808
olive	9808

within	9808
the	9808
precincts	9808
of	9808
the	9808
house	9808
in	9808
full	9808
vigour	9809
and	9809
about	9809
as	9809
thick	9809
as	9809
a	9809
bearing-post	9809
i	9809
built	9809
my	9809
room	9809
round	9809
this	9810
with	9810
strong	9810
walls	9810
of	9810
stone	9810
and	9810
a	9810
roof	9810
to	9810
cover	9810
them	9810
and	9810
i	9810
made	9810
the	9811
doors	9811
strong	9811
and	9811
well-fitting	9811
then	9811
i	9811
cut	9811
off	9811
the	9811
top	9811
boughs	9811
of	9811
the	9812
olive	9812
tree	9812
and	9812
left	9812
the	9812
stump	9812
standing	9812
this	9812
i	9812
dressed	9812
roughly	9812
from	9813
the	9813
root	9813
upwards	9813
and	9813
then	9813
worked	9813
with	9813
carpenter's	9813
tools	9813
well	9813
and	9814
skilfully	9814
straightening	9814
my	9814
work	9814
by	9814
drawing	9814
a	9814
line	9814
on	9814
the	9814
wood	9814
and	9815
making	9815
it	9815
into	9815
a	9815
bed-prop	9815
i	9815
then	9815
bored	9815
a	9815
hole	9815
down	9815
the	9815
middle	9815
and	9816
made	9816
it	9816
the	9816
centre-post	9816
of	9816
my	9816
bed	9816
at	9816
which	9816
i	9816
worked	9816
till	9816
i	9816
had	9816
finished	9817
it	9817
inlaying	9817
it	9817
with	9817
gold	9817
and	9817
silver	9817
after	9817
this	9817
i	9817
stretched	9817
a	9818
hide	9818
of	9818
crimson	9818
leather	9818
from	9818
one	9818
side	9818
of	9818
it	9818
to	9818
the	9818
other	9818
so	9818
you	9818
see	9819
i	9819
know	9819
all	9819
about	9819
it	9819
and	9819
i	9819
desire	9819
to	9819
learn	9819
whether	9819
it	9819
is	9819
still	9819
there	9820
or	9820
whether	9820
any	9820
one	9820
has	9820
been	9820
removing	9820
it	9820
by	9820
cutting	9820
down	9820
the	9820
olive	9821
tree	9821
at	9821
its	9821
roots	9821
when	9823
she	9823
heard	9823
the	9823
sure	9823
proofs	9823
ulysses	9823
now	9823
gave	9823
her	9823
she	9823
fairly	9823
broke	9823
down	9824
she	9824
flew	9824
weeping	9824
to	9824
his	9824
side	9824
flung	9824
her	9824
arms	9824
about	9824
his	9824
neck	9824
and	9825
kissed	9825
him	9825
do	9825
not	9825
be	9825
angry	9825
with	9825
me	9825
ulysses	9825
she	9825
cried	9825
you	9825
who	9826
are	9826
the	9826
wisest	9826
of	9826
mankind	9826
we	9826
have	9826
suffered	9826
both	9826
of	9826
us	9826
heaven	9826
has	9827
denied	9827
us	9827
the	9827
happiness	9827
of	9827
spending	9827
our	9827
youth	9827
and	9827
of	9827
growing	9827
old	9828
together	9828
do	9828
not	9828
then	9828
be	9828
aggrieved	9828
or	9828
take	9828
it	9828
amiss	9828
that	9828
i	9828
did	9828
not	9829
embrace	9829
you	9829
thus	9829
as	9829
soon	9829
as	9829
i	9829
saw	9829
you	9829
i	9829
have	9829
been	9829
shuddering	9829
all	9830
the	9830
time	9830
through	9830
fear	9830
that	9830
someone	9830
might	9830
come	9830
here	9830
and	9830
deceive	9830
me	9831
with	9831
a	9831
lying	9831
story	9831
for	9831
there	9831
are	9831
many	9831
very	9831
wicked	9831
people	9831
going	9831
about	9832
jove's	9832
daughter	9832
helen	9832
would	9832
never	9832
have	9832
yielded	9832
herself	9832
to	9832
a	9832
man	9833
from	9833
a	9833
foreign	9833
country	9833
if	9833
she	9833
had	9833
known	9833
that	9833
the	9833
sons	9833
of	9833
achaeans	9833
would	9834
come	9834
after	9834
her	9834
and	9834
bring	9834
her	9834
back	9834
heaven	9834
put	9834
it	9834
in	9834
her	9834
heart	9834
to	9835
do	9835
wrong	9835
and	9835
she	9835
gave	9835
no	9835
thought	9835
to	9835
that	9835
sin	9835
which	9835
has	9835
been	9835
the	9835
source	9836
of	9836
all	9836
our	9836
sorrows	9836
now	9836
however	9836
that	9836
you	9836
have	9836
convinced	9836
me	9836
by	9837
showing	9837
that	9837
you	9837
know	9837
all	9837
about	9837
our	9837
bed	9837
which	9837
no	9837
human	9837
being	9837
has	9837
ever	9838
seen	9838
but	9838
you	9838
and	9838
i	9838
and	9838
a	9838
single	9838
maid	9838
servant	9838
the	9838
daughter	9838
of	9838
actor	9839
who	9839
was	9839
given	9839
me	9839
by	9839
my	9839
father	9839
on	9839
my	9839
marriage	9839
and	9839
who	9839
keeps	9839
the	9840
doors	9840
of	9840
our	9840
room	9840
hard	9840
of	9840
belief	9840
though	9840
i	9840
have	9840
been	9840
i	9840
can	9840
mistrust	9840
no	9841
longer	9841
then	9843
ulysses	9843
in	9843
his	9843
turn	9843
melted	9843
and	9843
wept	9843
as	9843
he	9843
clasped	9843
his	9843
dear	9843
and	9843
faithful	9844
wife	9844
to	9844
his	9844
bosom	9844
as	9844
the	9844
sight	9844
of	9844
land	9844
is	9844
welcome	9844
to	9844
men	9844
who	9845
are	9845
swimming	9845
towards	9845
the	9845
shore	9845
when	9845
neptune	9845
has	9845
wrecked	9845
their	9845
ship	9846
with	9846
the	9846
fury	9846
of	9846
his	9846
winds	9846
and	9846
waves	9846
a	9846
few	9846
alone	9846
reach	9846
the	9846
land	9846
and	9847
these	9847
covered	9847
with	9847
brine	9847
are	9847
thankful	9847
when	9847
they	9847
find	9847
themselves	9847
on	9848
firm	9848
ground	9848
and	9848
out	9848
of	9848
danger	9848
even	9848
so	9848
was	9848
her	9848
husband	9848
welcome	9848
to	9849
her	9849
as	9849
she	9849
looked	9849
upon	9849
him	9849
and	9849
she	9849
could	9849
not	9849
tear	9849
her	9849
two	9849
fair	9849
arms	9850
from	9850
about	9850
his	9850
neck	9850
indeed	9850
they	9850
would	9850
have	9850
gone	9850
on	9850
indulging	9850
their	9851
sorrow	9851

go	9858
through	9858
with	9858

a	9873
country	9873
where	9873
the	9873
people	9873

never	9873
heard	9874
of	9874

a	9875
ship	9875
he	9875

i	9876
will	9876
not	9876
hide	9876
from	9876
you	9876
he	9876
said	9876
that	9877
a	9877
wayfarer	9877

meet	9877
me	9877
and	9877
ask	9877
me	9877
whether	9877
it	9877
was	9877
a	9877
winnowing	9877
shovel	9878
that	9878

on	9878
my	9878

one	9881
after	9881
the	9881
other	9881
as	9881
for	9881
myself	9881
he	9881
said	9881
that	9881
death	9881
should	9881
come	9881
to	9882
me	9882
from	9882
the	9882
sea	9882
and	9882
that	9882
my	9882
life	9882
should	9882
ebb	9882
away	9882
very	9882
gently	9882
when	9882
i	9883
was	9883
full	9883
of	9883
years	9883
and	9883
peace	9883
of	9883

my	9883
people	9883

bless	9883
me	9884
all	9884

should	9884
surely	9884
come	9884

and	9886
penelope	9886
said	9886

you	9886

then	9887
to	9887

some	9887
respite	9887
from	9887

themselves	9897
down	9897
to	9897
sleep	9897
in	9898
the	9898
cloisters	9898
when	9900

penelope	9900
had	9900
had	9900
their	9900
fill	9900
of	9900
love	9900
they	9900
fell	9900
talking	9900
with	9901
one	9901
another	9901
she	9901
told	9901
him	9901
how	9901
much	9901
she	9901
had	9901
had	9901
to	9901
bear	9901
in	9901
seeing	9901
the	9902
house	9902
filled	9902
with	9902
a	9902
crowd	9902
of	9902
wicked	9902
suitors	9902
who	9902
had	9902
killed	9902
so	9902
many	9903
sheep	9903
and	9903
oxen	9903
on	9903
her	9903
account	9903
and	9903

so	9903
many	9903
casks	9903
of	9903
wine	9904
ulysses	9904
in	9904
his	9904
turn	9904
told	9904
her	9904
what	9904
he	9904
had	9904
suffered	9904
and	9904
how	9904
much	9904
trouble	9905
he	9905
had	9905
himself	9905
given	9905
to	9905
other	9905
people	9905
he	9905
told	9905
her	9905
everything	9905
and	9906
she	9906
was	9906
so	9906
delighted	9906
to	9906
listen	9906
that	9906
she	9906
never	9906
went	9906
to	9906
sleep	9906
till	9906
he	9907
had	9907
ended	9907
his	9907
whole	9907
story	9907
he	9909
began	9909
with	9909
his	9909
victory	9909
over	9909
the	9909
cicons	9909
and	9909
how	9909
he	9909
thence	9909
reached	9909
the	9910
fertile	9910
land	9910
of	9910
the	9910
lotus-eaters	9910
he	9910
told	9910
her	9910
all	9910
about	9910
the	9910
cyclops	9910
and	9911
how	9911
he	9911
had	9911
punished	9911
him	9911
for	9911
having	9911
so	9911
ruthlessly	9911
eaten	9911
his	9911
brave	9911
comrades	9912
how	9912
he	9912
then	9912
went	9912
on	9912
to	9912
aeolus	9912
who	9912
received	9912
him	9912
hospitably	9912
and	9913
furthered	9913
him	9913
on	9913
his	9913
way	9913
but	9913
even	9913
so	9913
he	9913
was	9913
not	9913
to	9913
reach	9913
home	9913
for	9914
to	9914
his	9914
great	9914
grief	9914
a	9914
hurricane	9914
carried	9914
him	9914
out	9914
to	9914
sea	9914
again	9914
how	9914
he	9915
went	9915
on	9915
to	9915
the	9915
laestrygonian	9915
city	9915
telepylos	9915
where	9915
the	9915
people	9915
destroyed	9915
all	9916
his	9916
ships	9916
with	9916
their	9916
crews	9916
save	9916
himself	9916
and	9916
his	9916
own	9916
ship	9916
only	9916
then	9917
he	9917
told	9917
of	9917
cunning	9917
circe	9917
and	9917
her	9917
craft	9917
and	9917
how	9917
he	9917
sailed	9917
to	9917
the	9918
chill	9918
house	9918
of	9918
hades	9918
to	9918
consult	9918
the	9918
ghost	9918
of	9918
the	9918
theban	9918
prophet	9918
teiresias	9919
and	9919
how	9919
he	9919
saw	9919
his	9919
old	9919
comrades	9919
in	9919
arms	9919
and	9919
his	9919
mother	9919
who	9920
bore	9920
him	9920
and	9920
brought	9920
him	9920
up	9920
when	9920
he	9920
was	9920
a	9920
child	9920
how	9920
he	9920
then	9920
heard	9920
the	9921
wondrous	9921
singing	9921
of	9921
the	9921
sirens	9921
and	9921
went	9921
on	9921
to	9921
the	9921
wandering	9921
rocks	9921
and	9922
terrible	9922
charybdis	9922
and	9922
to	9922
scylla	9922
whom	9922
no	9922
man	9922
had	9922
ever	9922
yet	9922
passed	9922
in	9923
safety	9923
how	9923
his	9923
men	9923
then	9923
ate	9923
the	9923
cattle	9923
of	9923
the	9923
sun-god	9923
and	9923
how	9923
jove	9924
therefore	9924
struck	9924
the	9924
ship	9924
with	9924
his	9924
thunderbolts	9924
so	9924
that	9924
all	9924
his	9925
men	9925
perished	9925
together	9925
himself	9925
alone	9925
being	9925
left	9925
alive	9925
how	9925
at	9925
last	9926
he	9926
reached	9926
the	9926
ogygian	9926
island	9926
and	9926
the	9926
nymph	9926
calypso	9926
who	9926
kept	9926
him	9927
there	9927
in	9927
a	9927
cave	9927
and	9927
fed	9927
him	9927
and	9927
wanted	9927
him	9927
to	9927
marry	9927
her	9927
in	9927
which	9928
case	9928
she	9928
intended	9928
making	9928
him	9928
immortal	9928
so	9928
that	9928
he	9928
should	9928
never	9928
grow	9929
old	9929
but	9929
she	9929
could	9929
not	9929
persuade	9929
him	9929
to	9929
let	9929
her	9929
do	9929
so	9929
and	9929
how	9929
after	9930
much	9930
suffering	9930
he	9930
had	9930
found	9930
his	9930
way	9930
to	9930
the	9930
phaeacians	9930
who	9930
had	9930
treated	9931
him	9931
as	9931
though	9931
he	9931
had	9931
been	9931
a	9931
god	9931
and	9931
sent	9931
him	9931
back	9931
in	9931
a	9931
ship	9931
to	9932
his	9932
own	9932
country	9932
after	9932
having	9932
given	9932
him	9932
gold	9932
bronze	9932
and	9932
raiment	9932
in	9933
great	9933
abundance	9933
this	9933
was	9933
the	9933
last	9933
thing	9933
about	9933
which	9933
he	9933
told	9933
her	9933
for	9934
here	9934
a	9934
deep	9934
sleep	9934
took	9934
hold	9934
upon	9934
him	9934
and	9934
eased	9934
the	9934
burden	9934
of	9934
his	9934
sorrows	9935
then	9937
minerva	9937
bethought	9937
her	9937
of	9937
another	9937
matter	9937
when	9937
she	9937
deemed	9937
that	9937
ulysses	9938
had	9938
had	9938
both	9938
of	9938
his	9938
wife	9938
and	9938
of	9938
repose	9938
she	9938
bade	9938
gold-enthroned	9938
dawn	9939
rise	9939
out	9939
of	9939
oceanus	9939
that	9939
she	9939
might	9939
shed	9939
light	9939
upon	9939
mankind	9939
on	9939
this	9940
ulysses	9940
rose	9940
from	9940
his	9940
comfortable	9940
bed	9940
and	9940
said	9940
to	9940
penelope	9940
wife	9941
we	9941
have	9941
both	9941
of	9941
us	9941
had	9941
our	9941
full	9941
share	9941
of	9941
troubles	9941
you	9941
here	9941
in	9942
lamenting	9942
my	9942
absence	9942
and	9942
i	9942
in	9942
being	9942

he	9955
girded	9955
on	9955
his	9955

then	9955
he	9955
roused	9955
telemachus	9955
philoetius	9955

eumaeus	9956

to	9956
put	9956
on	9956
their	9956
armour	9956
also	9956
this	9956
they	9956
did	9957
and	9957
armed	9957
themselves	9957
when	9957
they	9957
had	9957
done	9957
so	9957
they	9957
opened	9957
the	9957

sallied	9958
forth	9958
ulysses	9958

concealed	9959
them	9959
in	9959
darkness	9959

led	9959
them	9959
quickly	9959
out	9960
of	9960
the	9960
town	9960
book	9964
xxiv	9964
then	9966
mercury	9966
of	9966
cyllene	9966
summoned	9966
the	9966
ghosts	9966
of	9966
the	9966
suitors	9966
and	9966
in	9966
his	9967
hand	9967
he	9967
held	9967
the	9967
fair	9967
golden	9967
wand	9967
with	9967
which	9967
he	9967
seals	9967
men's	9967
eyes	9967
in	9968
sleep	9968
or	9968
wakes	9968
them	9968
just	9968
as	9968
he	9968
pleases	9968
with	9968
this	9968
he	9968
roused	9968
the	9968
ghosts	9969
and	9969
led	9969
them	9969
while	9969
they	9969
followed	9969
whining	9969
and	9969
gibbering	9969
behind	9969
him	9970
as	9970
bats	9970
fly	9970
squealing	9970
in	9970
the	9970
hollow	9970
of	9970
some	9970
great	9970
cave	9970
when	9970
one	9971
of	9971
them	9971
has	9971
fallen	9971
out	9971
of	9971
the	9971
cluster	9971
in	9971
which	9971
they	9971
hang	9971
even	9971
so	9972
did	9972
the	9972
ghosts	9972
whine	9972
and	9972
squeal	9972
as	9972
mercury	9972
the	9972
healer	9972
of	9972
sorrow	9972
led	9973
them	9973
down	9973
into	9973
the	9973
dark	9973
abode	9973
of	9973
death	9973
when	9973
they	9973
had	9973
passed	9973
the	9973
waters	9974
of	9974
oceanus	9974
and	9974
the	9974
rock	9974
leucas	9974

came	9974
to	9974
the	9974
gates	9974
of	9974
the	9974
sun	9975
and	9975
the	9975
land	9975
of	9975
dreams	9975
whereon	9975
they	9975
reached	9975
the	9975
meadow	9975
of	9975
asphodel	9975
where	9976
dwell	9976
the	9976
souls	9976

them	9976
that	9976

labour	9976
no	9976

here	9978
they	9978
found	9978
the	9978

those	9978
of	9978
patroclus	9979
antilochus	9979

ajax	9979
who	9979
was	9979
the	9979
finest	9979
and	9979
handsomest	9979
man	9980
of	9980
all	9980
the	9980
danaans	9980
after	9980
the	9980
son	9980
of	9980
peleus	9980
himself	9980
they	9982
gathered	9982
round	9982
the	9982
ghost	9982
of	9982
the	9982
son	9982
of	9982
peleus	9982

the	9982

them	9983
sorrowing	9983
bitterly	9983
round	9983
him	9983
were	9983
gathered	9983
also	9984
the	9984
ghosts	9984
of	9984
those	9984
who	9984
had	9984
perished	9984
with	9984
him	9984
in	9984
the	9984
house	9984
of	9984
aeisthus	9985

the	9985

first	9985
son	9987
of	9987
atreus	9987
it	9987
said	9987
we	9987
used	9987
to	9987
say	9987
that	9987
jove	9987

loved	9987
you	9987
better	9988
from	9988
first	9988
to	9988
last	9988
than	9988
any	9988
other	9988
hero	9988
for	9988
you	9988
were	9988
captain	9988
over	9989
many	9989
and	9989
brave	9989
men	9989
when	9989
we	9989
were	9989
all	9989
fighting	9989
together	9989
before	9989
troy	9990

the	9990

of	9990
death	9990

no	9990

laid	9990
upon	9991
you	9991
all	9991
too	9991
early	9991
better	9991
for	9991
you	9991
had	9991
you	9991
fallen	9991
at	9991
troy	9991
in	9991
the	9991
hey-day	9992
of	9992
your	9992
renown	9992
for	9992
the	9992
achaeans	9992
would	9992
have	9992
built	9992
a	9992
mound	9992
over	9993
your	9993
ashes	9993
and	9993
your	9993
son	9993
would	9993
have	9993
been	9993
heir	9993
to	9993
your	9993
good	9993
name	9993
whereas	9994
it	9994
has	9994
now	9994
been	9994
your	9994
lot	9994
to	9994
come	9994
to	9994
a	9994
most	9994
miserable	9994
end	9994
happy	9996
son	9996
of	9996
peleus	9996
answered	9996
the	9996
ghost	9996
of	9996
agamemnon	9996
for	9996
having	9996
died	9997
at	9997
troy	9997
far	9997
from	9997
argos	9997
while	9997
the	9997
bravest	9997
of	9997
the	9997
trojans	9997
and	9997
the	9998
achaeans	9998
fell	9998
round	9998
you	9998
fighting	9998
for	9998
your	9998
body	9998
there	9998
you	9998
lay	9998
in	9999
the	9999
whirling	9999
clouds	9999
of	9999
dust	9999
all	9999
huge	9999
and	9999
hugely	9999
heedless	9999
now	9999
of	10000
your	10000
chivalry	10000
we	10000
fought	10000
the	10000
whole	10000
of	10000
the	10000
livelong	10000
day	10000
nor	10000
should	10000
we	10001
ever	10001
have	10001
left	10001
off	10001
if	10001
jove	10001
had	10001
not	10001
sent	10001
a	10001
hurricane	10001
to	10001
stay	10001
us	10001
then	10002
when	10002
we	10002
had	10002
borne	10002
you	10002
to	10002
the	10002
ships	10002
out	10002
of	10002
the	10002
fray	10002
we	10002
laid	10002
you	10003
on	10003
your	10003
bed	10003
and	10003
cleansed	10003
your	10003
fair	10003
skin	10003
with	10003
warm	10003
water	10003
and	10003
with	10003
ointments	10004
the	10004
danaans	10004
tore	10004
their	10004
hair	10004
and	10004
wept	10004
bitterly	10004
round	10004
about	10004
you	10005
your	10005
mother	10005
when	10005
she	10005
heard	10005
came	10005
with	10005
her	10005
immortal	10005
nymphs	10005
from	10005
out	10006
of	10006
the	10006
sea	10006
and	10006
the	10006
sound	10006
of	10006
a	10006
great	10006
wailing	10006
went	10006
forth	10006
over	10006
the	10006
waters	10007
so	10007
that	10007
the	10007
achaeans	10007
quaked	10007
for	10007
fear	10007
they	10007
would	10007
have	10007
fled	10007
panic-stricken	10008
to	10008
their	10008
ships	10008
had	10008
not	10008
wise	10008
old	10008
nestor	10008
whose	10008
counsel	10008
was	10009
ever	10009
truest	10009
checked	10009
them	10009
saying	10009
hold	10009
argives	10009
fly	10009
not	10009
sons	10009
of	10010
the	10010
achaeans	10010
this	10010
is	10010
his	10010
mother	10010
coming	10010
from	10010
the	10010
sea	10010
with	10010
her	10010
immortal	10010
nymphs	10011
to	10011
view	10011
the	10011
body	10011
of	10011
her	10011
son	10011
thus	10013
he	10013
spoke	10013
and	10013
the	10013
achaeans	10013
feared	10013
no	10013
more	10013
the	10013
daughters	10013
of	10013
the	10014
old	10014
man	10014
of	10014
the	10014
sea	10014
stood	10014
round	10014
you	10014
weeping	10014
bitterly	10014
and	10014
clothed	10014
you	10015
in	10015
immortal	10015
raiment	10015
the	10015
nine	10015
muses	10015
also	10015
came	10015
and	10015
lifted	10015
up	10015
their	10015
sweet	10016
voices	10016
in	10016
lament	10016
calling	10016
and	10016
answering	10016
one	10016
another	10016
there	10016
was	10016
not	10017
an	10017
argive	10017
but	10017
wept	10017
for	10017
pity	10017
of	10017
the	10017
dirge	10017
they	10017
chaunted	10017
days	10017
and	10017
nights	10018
seven	10018
and	10018
ten	10018
we	10018
mourned	10018
you	10018
mortals	10018
and	10018
immortals	10018
but	10018
on	10018
the	10019
eighteenth	10019
day	10019
we	10019
gave	10019
you	10019
to	10019
the	10019
flames	10019
and	10019
many	10019
a	10019
fat	10019
sheep	10019
with	10020
many	10020
an	10020
ox	10020
did	10020
we	10020
slay	10020
in	10020
sacrifice	10020
around	10020
you	10020
you	10020
were	10020
burnt	10020
in	10021
raiment	10021
of	10021
the	10021
gods	10021
with	10021
rich	10021
resins	10021
and	10021
with	10021
honey	10021
while	10021
heroes	10021
horse	10022
and	10022
foot	10022
clashed	10022
their	10022
armour	10022
round	10022
the	10022
pile	10022
as	10022
you	10022
were	10022
burning	10022
with	10023
the	10023
tramp	10023
as	10023
of	10023
a	10023
great	10023
multitude	10023
but	10023
when	10023
the	10023
flames	10023
of	10023
heaven	10023
had	10024
done	10024
their	10024
work	10024
we	10024
gathered	10024
your	10024
white	10024
bones	10024
at	10024
daybreak	10024
and	10024
laid	10025
them	10025
in	10025
ointments	10025
and	10025
in	10025
pure	10025
wine	10025
your	10025
mother	10025
brought	10025
us	10025
a	10025
golden	10026
vase	10026
to	10026
hold	10026
them	10026

and	10026
work	10026
of	10026
vulcan	10026
himself	10026
in	10027
this	10027
we	10027
mingled	10027
your	10027
bleached	10027
bones	10027
with	10027
those	10027
of	10027
patroclus	10027
who	10027
had	10028
gone	10028
before	10028
you	10028
and	10028
separate	10028
we	10028
enclosed	10028
also	10028
those	10028
of	10028
antilochus	10028
who	10029
had	10029
been	10029
closer	10029
to	10029
you	10029
than	10029
any	10029
other	10029
of	10029
your	10029
comrades	10029
now	10029
that	10029

as	10042
for	10042
me	10042
what	10042
solace	10042
had	10042
i	10042
when	10042
the	10043
days	10043
of	10043
my	10043

thus	10046
did	10046
they	10046

presently	10046
mercury	10046
came	10046
up	10046
to	10046
them	10046
with	10046
the	10047

the	10047
ghosts	10047

astonished	10048
at	10048
seeing	10048
them	10048
and	10048
went	10048
up	10049
to	10049
them	10049
at	10049
once	10049
the	10049
ghost	10049
of	10049
agamemnon	10049
recognized	10049
amphimedon	10049
son	10049
of	10050
melaneus	10050
who	10050
lived	10050

ithaca	10050
and	10050
had	10050
been	10050
his	10050
host	10050
so	10050
it	10050
began	10050
to	10051
talk	10051
to	10051
him	10051
amphimedon	10053
it	10053
said	10053

finer	10055
body	10055
of	10055
men	10055
from	10055
any	10055

neptune	10055
raise	10055
his	10055
winds	10056
and	10056
waves	10056
against	10056
you	10056
when	10056
you	10056

did	10056
your	10056

an	10057
end	10057
of	10057
you	10057
on	10057
the	10057

your	10059

how	10060
i	10060
came	10060
to	10060
your	10060

join	10060
us	10061
with	10061
his	10061
ships	10061
against	10061
troy	10061
it	10061
was	10061
a	10061
whole	10061
month	10061
ere	10061
we	10061
could	10061
resume	10062
our	10062
voyage	10062
for	10062
we	10062
had	10062
hard	10062
work	10062
to	10062
persuade	10062
ulysses	10062
to	10062
come	10062
with	10063
us	10063
and	10065
the	10065
ghost	10065
of	10065
amphimedon	10065
answered	10065
agamemnon	10065
son	10065
of	10065
atreus	10065
king	10065
of	10066
men	10066
i	10066
remember	10066
everything	10066
that	10066
you	10066
have	10066
said	10066
and	10066
will	10066
tell	10066
you	10066
fully	10067
and	10067
accurately	10067
about	10067
the	10067
way	10067
in	10067
which	10067
our	10067
end	10067
was	10067
brought	10067
about	10067
ulysses	10068
had	10068
been	10068
long	10068
gone	10068
and	10068
we	10068
were	10068
courting	10068
his	10068
wife	10068
who	10068
did	10068
not	10069
say	10069
point	10069
blank	10069
that	10069
she	10069
would	10069
not	10069
marry	10069
nor	10069
yet	10069
bring	10069
matters	10069
to	10070
an	10070
end	10070
for	10070
she	10070
meant	10070
to	10070
compass	10070
our	10070
destruction	10070
this	10070
then	10070
was	10070
the	10071
trick	10071
she	10071
played	10071
us	10071
she	10071
set	10071
up	10071
a	10071
great	10071
tambour	10071
frame	10071
in	10071
her	10071
room	10071
and	10072
began	10072
to	10072
work	10072
on	10072
an	10072
enormous	10072
piece	10072
of	10072
fine	10072
needlework	10072
sweethearts	10072
said	10073
she	10073
ulysses	10073
is	10073
indeed	10073
dead	10073
still	10073
do	10073
not	10073
press	10073
me	10073
to	10073
marry	10073
again	10074
immediately	10074
wait	10074
for	10074
i	10074
would	10074
not	10074
have	10074
my	10074
skill	10074
in	10074
needlework	10074
perish	10075
unrecorded	10075
till	10075
i	10075
have	10075
completed	10075
a	10075
pall	10075
for	10075
the	10075
hero	10075
laertes	10075
against	10076
the	10076
time	10076
when	10076
death	10076
shall	10076
take	10076
him	10076
he	10076
is	10076
very	10076
rich	10076
and	10076
the	10076
women	10077
of	10077
the	10077
place	10077
will	10077
talk	10077
if	10077
he	10077
is	10077
laid	10077
out	10077
without	10077
a	10077
pall	10077
this	10077
is	10078
what	10078
she	10078
said	10078
and	10078
we	10078
assented	10078
whereupon	10078
we	10078
could	10078
see	10078
her	10078
working	10078
upon	10079
her	10079
great	10079
web	10079
all	10079
day	10079
long	10079
but	10079
at	10079
night	10079
she	10079
would	10079
unpick	10079
the	10079
stitches	10080
again	10080
by	10080
torchlight	10080
she	10080
fooled	10080
us	10080
in	10080
this	10080
way	10080
for	10080
three	10080
years	10081
without	10081
our	10081
finding	10081
it	10081
out	10081
but	10081
as	10081
time	10081
wore	10081
on	10081
and	10081
she	10081
was	10081
now	10082
in	10082
her	10082
fourth	10082
year	10082
in	10082
the	10082
waning	10082
of	10082
moons	10082
and	10082
many	10082
days	10082
had	10082
been	10082
accomplished	10083
one	10083
of	10083
her	10083
maids	10083
who	10083
knew	10083
what	10083
she	10083
was	10083
doing	10083
told	10083
us	10083
and	10084
we	10084
caught	10084
her	10084
in	10084
the	10084
act	10084
of	10084
undoing	10084
her	10084
work	10084
so	10084
she	10084
had	10084
to	10084
finish	10084
it	10085
whether	10085
she	10085
would	10085
or	10085
no	10085
and	10085
when	10085
she	10085
showed	10085
us	10085
the	10085
robe	10085
she	10085
had	10085
made	10086
after	10086
she	10086
had	10086
had	10086
it	10086
washed	10086
its	10086
splendour	10086
was	10086
as	10086
that	10086
of	10086
the	10086
sun	10087
or	10087
moon	10087
then	10089
some	10089
malicious	10089
god	10089
conveyed	10089
ulysses	10089
to	10089
the	10089
upland	10089
farm	10089
where	10089
his	10090
swineherd	10090
lives	10090
thither	10090
presently	10090
came	10090
also	10090
his	10090
son	10090
returning	10090
from	10091
a	10091
voyage	10091
to	10091
pylos	10091
and	10091
the	10091
two	10091
came	10091
to	10091
the	10091
town	10091
when	10091
they	10091
had	10091
hatched	10092
their	10092
plot	10092
for	10092
our	10092
destruction	10092
telemachus	10092
came	10092
first	10092
and	10092
then	10093
after	10093
him	10093
accompanied	10093
by	10093
the	10093
swineherd	10093
came	10093
ulysses	10093
clad	10093
in	10093
rags	10094
and	10094
leaning	10094
on	10094
a	10094
staff	10094
as	10094
though	10094
he	10094
were	10094
some	10094
miserable	10094
old	10094
beggar	10094
he	10095
came	10095
so	10095
unexpectedly	10095
that	10095
none	10095
of	10095
us	10095
knew	10095
him	10095
not	10095
even	10095
the	10095
older	10095
ones	10096
among	10096
us	10096
and	10096
we	10096
reviled	10096
him	10096
and	10096
threw	10096
things	10096
at	10096
him	10096
he	10096
endured	10096
both	10097
being	10097
struck	10097
and	10097
insulted	10097
without	10097
a	10097
word	10097
though	10097
he	10097
was	10097
in	10097
his	10097
own	10098
house	10098
but	10098
when	10098
the	10098
will	10098
of	10098
aegis-bearing	10098
jove	10098
inspired	10098
him	10098
he	10098
and	10099
telemachus	10099
took	10099
the	10099
armour	10099
and	10099
hid	10099
it	10099
in	10099
an	10099
inner	10099
chamber	10099
bolting	10099
the	10100
doors	10100
behind	10100
them	10100
then	10100
he	10100
cunningly	10100
made	10100
his	10100
wife	10100
offer	10100
his	10100
bow	10100
and	10101
a	10101
quantity	10101
of	10101
iron	10101
to	10101
be	10101
contended	10101
for	10101
by	10101
us	10101
ill-fated	10101
suitors	10101
and	10102
this	10102
was	10102
the	10102
beginning	10102
of	10102
our	10102
end	10102
for	10102
not	10102
one	10102
of	10102
us	10102
could	10102
string	10102
the	10103
bow	10103
nor	10103
nearly	10103
do	10103
so	10103
when	10103
it	10103
was	10103
about	10103
to	10103
reach	10103
the	10103
hands	10103
of	10103
ulysses	10104
we	10104
all	10104
of	10104
us	10104
shouted	10104
out	10104
that	10104
it	10104
should	10104
not	10104
be	10104
given	10104
him	10104
no	10105
matter	10105
what	10105
he	10105
might	10105
say	10105
but	10105
telemachus	10105
insisted	10105
on	10105
his	10105
having	10105
it	10106
when	10106
he	10106
had	10106
got	10106
it	10106
in	10106
his	10106
hands	10106
he	10106
strung	10106
it	10106
with	10106
ease	10106
and	10106
sent	10106
his	10107
arrow	10107
through	10107
the	10107
iron	10107
then	10107
he	10107
stood	10107
on	10107
the	10107
floor	10107
of	10107
the	10107
cloister	10107
and	10108
poured	10108
his	10108
arrows	10108
on	10108
the	10108
ground	10108
glaring	10108
fiercely	10108
about	10108
him	10108
first	10108
he	10109
killed	10109
antinous	10109
and	10109
then	10109
aiming	10109
straight	10109
before	10109
him	10109
he	10109
let	10109
fly	10109
his	10110
deadly	10110
darts	10110
and	10110
they	10110
fell	10110
thick	10110
on	10110
one	10110
another	10110
it	10110
was	10110
plain	10110
that	10111
some	10111
one	10111
of	10111
the	10111
gods	10111
was	10111
helping	10111
them	10111
for	10111

fell	10111
upon	10111
us	10111
with	10112
might	10112
and	10112
main	10112
throughout	10112
the	10112
cloisters	10112
and	10112
there	10112
was	10112
a	10112
hideous	10112
sound	10113
of	10113
groaning	10113
as	10113
our	10113
brains	10113
were	10113
being	10113
battered	10113
in	10113
and	10113
the	10113

seethed	10114
with	10114
our	10114

how	10114
we	10114
came	10114
by	10114
our	10114
end	10114
and	10115
our	10115
bodies	10115
are	10115
lying	10115
still	10115
un-cared	10115

know	10116
what	10116
has	10116
happened	10116
so	10116
that	10116
they	10117
cannot	10117
lay	10117
us	10117
out	10117
and	10117
wash	10117
the	10117
black	10117
blood	10117
from	10117
our	10117
wounds	10117
making	10117

such	10121
rare	10121

how	10126
far	10126
otherwise	10126

even	10128
on	10128
the	10128

thus	10130
did	10130
they	10130
converse	10130
in	10130
the	10130
house	10130
of	10130

down	10130
within	10130
the	10130

the	10131
others	10131
passed	10131
out	10131
of	10131
the	10132
town	10132
and	10132
soon	10132
reached	10132
the	10132
fair	10132
and	10132
well-tilled	10132
farm	10132
of	10132
laertes	10132
which	10133
he	10133
had	10133
reclaimed	10133
with	10133
infinite	10133
labour	10133
here	10133
was	10133
his	10133

a	10134
lean-to	10134

the	10134
slaves	10134

worked	10134
for	10134
him	10134
slept	10135
and	10135
sat	10135
and	10135
ate	10135
while	10135
inside	10135
the	10135
house	10135
there	10135
was	10135
an	10135
old	10135
sicel	10135
woman	10136
who	10136
looked	10136
after	10136
him	10136
in	10136
this	10136
his	10136
country-farm	10136
when	10136
ulysses	10136
got	10137
there	10137
he	10137
said	10137
to	10137
his	10137
son	10137
and	10137
to	10137
the	10137
other	10137
two	10137
go	10139
to	10139
the	10139
house	10139
and	10139
kill	10139
the	10139
best	10139
pig	10139
that	10139
you	10139
can	10139
find	10139
for	10139
dinner	10139
meanwhile	10140
i	10140
want	10140
to	10140
see	10140
whether	10140
my	10140
father	10140
will	10140
know	10140
me	10140
or	10140
fail	10140
to	10140
recognize	10141
me	10141
after	10141
so	10141
long	10141
an	10141
absence	10141
he	10143
then	10143
took	10143
off	10143
his	10143
armour	10143
and	10143
gave	10143
it	10143
to	10143
eumaeus	10143
and	10143
philoetius	10143
who	10144
went	10144
straight	10144
on	10144
to	10144
the	10144
house	10144
while	10144
he	10144
turned	10144
off	10144
into	10144
the	10144
vineyard	10144
to	10145
make	10145
trial	10145
of	10145
his	10145
father	10145
as	10145
he	10145
went	10145
down	10145
into	10145
the	10145
great	10145
orchard	10145
he	10146
did	10146
not	10146
see	10146
dolius	10146
nor	10146
any	10146
of	10146
his	10146
sons	10146
nor	10146
of	10146
the	10146
other	10146
bondsmen	10146
for	10147
they	10147
were	10147
all	10147
gathering	10147
thorns	10147
to	10147
make	10147
a	10147
fence	10147
for	10147
the	10147
vineyard	10147
at	10148
the	10148
place	10148
where	10148
the	10148
old	10148
man	10148
had	10148
told	10148
them	10148
he	10148
therefore	10148
found	10148
his	10148
father	10149
alone	10149
hoeing	10149
a	10149
vine	10149
he	10149
had	10149
on	10149
a	10149
dirty	10149
old	10149
shirt	10149
patched	10149
and	10150
very	10150
shabby	10150
his	10150
legs	10150
were	10150
bound	10150
round	10150
with	10150
thongs	10150
of	10150
oxhide	10150
to	10150
save	10151
him	10151
from	10151
the	10151
brambles	10151
and	10151
he	10151
also	10151
wore	10151
sleeves	10151
of	10151
leather	10151
he	10151
had	10152
a	10152
goat	10152
skin	10152
cap	10152
on	10152
his	10152
head	10152
and	10152
was	10152
looking	10152
very	10152
woe-begone	10152
when	10153
ulysses	10153
saw	10153
him	10153
so	10153
worn	10153
so	10153
old	10153
and	10153
full	10153
of	10153
sorrow	10153
he	10153
stood	10153
still	10154
under	10154
a	10154
tall	10154
pear	10154
tree	10154
and	10154
began	10154
to	10154
weep	10154
he	10154
doubted	10154
whether	10154
to	10155
embrace	10155
him	10155
kiss	10155
him	10155
and	10155
tell	10155
him	10155
all	10155
about	10155
his	10155
having	10155
come	10155
home	10155
or	10156
whether	10156
he	10156
should	10156
first	10156
question	10156
him	10156
and	10156
see	10156
what	10156
he	10156
would	10156
say	10156
in	10157
the	10157
end	10157
he	10157
deemed	10157
it	10157
best	10157
to	10157
be	10157
crafty	10157
with	10157
him	10157
so	10157
in	10157
this	10157
mind	10157
he	10158
went	10158
up	10158
to	10158
his	10158
father	10158
who	10158
was	10158
bending	10158
down	10158
and	10158
digging	10158
about	10158
a	10158
plant	10159
i	10161
see	10161
sir	10161
said	10161
ulysses	10161
that	10161
you	10161
are	10161
an	10161
excellent	10161
gardener	10161
what	10161
pains	10162
you	10162
take	10162
with	10162
it	10162
to	10162
be	10162
sure	10162
there	10162
is	10162
not	10162
a	10162
single	10162
plant	10162
not	10162
a	10163
fig	10163
tree	10163
vine	10163
olive	10163
pear	10163
nor	10163
flower	10163
bed	10163
but	10163
bears	10163
the	10163
trace	10163
of	10164
your	10164
attention	10164
i	10164
trust	10164
however	10164
that	10164
you	10164
will	10164
not	10164
be	10164
offended	10164
if	10165
i	10165
say	10165
that	10165
you	10165
take	10165
better	10165
care	10165
of	10165
your	10165
garden	10165
than	10165
of	10165
yourself	10165
you	10166
are	10166
old	10166
unsavoury	10166
and	10166
very	10166
meanly	10166
clad	10166
it	10166
cannot	10166
be	10166
because	10166
you	10167
are	10167
idle	10167
that	10167
your	10167
master	10167
takes	10167
such	10167
poor	10167
care	10167
of	10167
you	10167
indeed	10167
your	10168
face	10168
and	10168
figure	10168
have	10168
nothing	10168
of	10168
the	10168
slave	10168
about	10168
them	10168
and	10168
proclaim	10168
you	10169
of	10169
noble	10169
birth	10169
i	10169
should	10169
have	10169
said	10169
that	10169
you	10169
were	10169
one	10169
of	10169
those	10169
who	10170
should	10170
wash	10170
well	10170
eat	10170
well	10170
and	10170
lie	10170
soft	10170
at	10170
night	10170
as	10170
old	10170
men	10170
have	10170
a	10171
right	10171
to	10171
do	10171
but	10171
tell	10171
me	10171
and	10171
tell	10171
me	10171
true	10171
whose	10171
bondman	10171

you	10171
and	10172

whose	10172
garden	10172

you	10172
working	10172
tell	10172
me	10172
also	10172
about	10172
another	10172
matter	10172

a	10173
man	10173
just	10173
now	10174
who	10174
said	10174
so	10174
but	10174
he	10174
was	10174
a	10174
dull	10174
fellow	10174
and	10174
had	10174
not	10174
the	10174
patience	10174
to	10175
hear	10175
my	10175
story	10175
out	10175
when	10175

him	10175
about	10175
an	10175
old	10175
friend	10175
of	10175
mine	10176
whether	10176
he	10176
was	10176
still	10176

the	10176
house	10177
of	10177

this	10177
man	10177
came	10177
to	10177
my	10177
house	10178
once	10178
when	10178
i	10178
was	10178
in	10178
my	10178
own	10178
country	10178
and	10178
never	10178
yet	10178
did	10178
any	10178
stranger	10178
come	10179
to	10179
me	10179
whom	10179
i	10179
liked	10179
better	10179
he	10179
said	10179
that	10179
his	10179
family	10179
came	10179
from	10179

with	10222
the	10222
dust	10222
from	10222

grey	10223
head	10223
groaning	10223
heavily	10223

the	10223
heart	10223

was	10223
touched	10224
and	10224

looked	10224
upon	10224

me	10243
fifty	10243
rows	10243
of	10243

and	10244
they	10244
yield	10244
grapes	10244
of	10244
every	10244
kind	10245
when	10245
the	10245

have	10249
gone	10249
off	10249
into	10249
a	10249
swoon	10249
but	10249

they	10342
thought	10342
would	10342
not	10342

now	10342
however	10342
let	10343
it	10343

that	10344
you	10344
have	10344
been	10344
drawing	10344
down	10344
evil	10344
on	10344
your	10344
own	10344
heads	10344
this	10346
was	10346
what	10346
he	10346
said	10346
and	10346
more	10346
than	10346
half	10346
raised	10346
a	10346
loud	10346
shout	10346
and	10346
at	10347
once	10347

the	10347
rest	10347

where	10347
they	10347
were	10347
for	10347
the	10348
speech	10348
of	10348
halitherses	10348
displeased	10348
them	10348
and	10348
they	10348
sided	10348
with	10348
eupeithes	10348
they	10349
therefore	10349
hurried	10349
off	10349
for	10349
their	10349
armour	10349
and	10349
when	10349
they	10349

armed	10349
themselves	10350
they	10350
met	10350
together	10350
in	10350
front	10350
of	10350
the	10350
city	10350
and	10350
eupeithes	10350
led	10351
them	10351
on	10351
in	10351
their	10351
folly	10351
he	10351
thought	10351
he	10351
was	10351
going	10351
to	10351
avenge	10351
the	10351
murder	10352
of	10352
his	10352
son	10352
whereas	10352
in	10352
truth	10352
he	10352
was	10352
never	10352
to	10352
return	10352
but	10352
was	10352
himself	10353
to	10353
perish	10353
in	10353
his	10353
attempt	10353
then	10355
minerva	10355
said	10355
to	10355

you	10359
ask	10359
me	10359
was	10359
it	10359
not	10359
by	10359
your	10360
own	10360
arrangement	10360
that	10360
ulysses	10360
came	10360
home	10360
and	10360
took	10360
his	10360
revenge	10360

i	10361
think	10361
will	10362
be	10362
most	10362

revenged	10362
let	10363
them	10363
swear	10363
to	10363
a	10363
solemn	10363
covenant	10363
in	10363
virtue	10363
of	10363
which	10363
he	10363
shall	10363
continue	10363
to	10364
rule	10364
while	10364
we	10364
cause	10364
the	10364
others	10364
to	10364
forgive	10364
and	10364
forget	10364
the	10364
massacre	10364
of	10365
their	10365
sons	10365
and	10365
brothers	10365
let	10365
them	10365
then	10365
all	10365
become	10365

let	10366
peace	10366

plenty	10366
reign	10366
this	10368
was	10368
what	10368
minerva	10368
was	10368
already	10368
eager	10368
to	10368
bring	10368
about	10368
so	10368
down	10368
she	10368
darted	10369
from	10369
off	10369
the	10369
topmost	10369

done	10371
dinner	10371

up	10373
to	10373

see	10374
them	10374
all	10374
quite	10374
near	10374

necessity	10379
in	10379
spite	10379
of	10379

sallied	10380
forth	10381
ulysses	10381
leading	10381
the	10381

then	10383
jove's	10383

hurl	10399
it	10399
as	10401
she	10401
spoke	10401
she	10401
infused	10401
fresh	10401
vigour	10401
into	10401
him	10401
and	10401
when	10401
he	10401
had	10401
prayed	10401
to	10402
her	10402
he	10402
poised	10402
his	10402

his	10404
armour	10404
rang	10404
rattling	10404
round	10404
him	10404
as	10404
he	10404
fell	10404
heavily	10404
to	10404
the	10404
ground	10404
meantime	10405
ulysses	10405
and	10405
his	10405
son	10405
fell	10405
the	10405
front	10405
line	10405
of	10405
the	10405
foe	10405
and	10405
smote	10405
them	10406
with	10406
their	10406
swords	10406
and	10406
spears	10406
indeed	10406
they	10406
would	10406
have	10406
killed	10406
every	10407
one	10407
of	10407
them	10407
and	10407
prevented	10407
them	10407
from	10407
ever	10407
getting	10407
home	10407
again	10407
only	10408
minerva	10408
raised	10408
her	10408
voice	10408
aloud	10408
and	10408
made	10408
every	10408
one	10408
pause	10408
men	10408
of	10409
ithaca	10409
she	10409
cried	10409
cease	10409
this	10409
dreadful	10409
war	10409
and	10409
settle	10409
the	10409
matter	10409
at	10410
once	10410
without	10410
further	10410
bloodshed	10410
on	10412
this	10412
pale	10412
fear	10412
seized	10412
every	10412
one	10412
they	10412
were	10412
so	10412
frightened	10412
that	10412
their	10412
arms	10413
dropped	10413
from	10413
their	10413
hands	10413
and	10413
fell	10413
upon	10413
the	10413
ground	10413
at	10413
the	10413
sound	10413
of	10414
the	10414
goddess's	10414
voice	10414
and	10414
they	10414
fled	10414
back	10414
to	10414
the	10414
city	10414
for	10414
their	10414
lives	10414
but	10415
ulysses	10415
gave	10415
a	10415
great	10415
cry	10415
and	10415
gathering	10415
himself	10415
together	10415
swooped	10415
down	10416
like	10416
a	10416
soaring	10416
eagle	10416
then	10416
the	10416
son	10416
of	10416
saturn	10416
sent	10416
a	10416
thunderbolt	10416
of	10417
fire	10417
that	10417
fell	10417
just	10417
in	10417
front	10417
of	10417
minerva	10417
so	10417
she	10417
said	10417
to	10417
ulysses	10417
ulysses	10418

this	10418
warful	10418

jove	10418

angry	10419
with	10419
you	10419
thus	10421
spoke	10421
minerva	10421
and	10421
ulysses	10421
obeyed	10421
her	10421
gladly	10421
then	10421
minerva	10421
assumed	10421
the	10422
form	10422
and	10422
voice	10422
of	10422
mentor	10422
and	10422
presently	10422
made	10422
a	10422
covenant	10422
of	10422
